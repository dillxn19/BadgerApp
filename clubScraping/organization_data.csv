"Adventist Christian Fellowship - Madison","Hey there, we are so glad you've visited our page!
We are UW-Madison students who at some point in our lives started to ask deep questions and wonder about God and such things, and then experienced that God is actually a loving and good God, and, thus, we really want to share with others the life-changing power of the Bible here, on campus, in our busy, everyday lives, which can be full of problems, worries, and struggles.
Why is it cool?) The acronym ""ACF"" explains it very well, though it may seem hard to understand at first:
A - Adventist. Adventists emphasize that the imminent second coming (""advent"") of Jesus gives hope to each one of us because this will be the day when our whole life, regardless of how it was, can be made perfect, and we can become fully happy, just as God planned it to be.
C - Christian. Christians know that Jesus loved each person, each identity, and each individual so much, that He decided to give up everything (including His life) so that we may be restored, and our lives - fulfilled. This focus on His amazing love is something that can truly change your life and ours.
F - Fellowship. We all have a deep longing for a community and fellowship, and no one likes to feel alone or excluded, though this often happens on such a big campus as ours. But when we get to know God's love, we are so filled with it that we naturally tend (and are able) to share this gift with our community, while being focused on Jesus. No community becomes more united than the one where God is at the center.
  Still wondering what all these words like ""God's love"", ""fulfillment"", ""true community"" or ""belonging"" mean?
Come and join our next event, and you'll figure it out!

Relevant, Replicable, and Recognizable: organizationally, we cannot reach our vision if the products and services we offer are not relevant to our customers, replicable across chapters and across time and recognizable as ours so as to be discernible from our competition.

The American Medical Women’s Association (AMWA) is an organization of women physicians, medical students and other persons dedicated to serving as the unique voice for women’s health and the advancement of women in medicine.

The curriculum covers topics such as moral circle expansion, veganism, animal advocacy as a social justice issue, the pros and cons of the field of ""effective animal advocacy,"" invertebrate welfare, and wild animal welfare.
  It's not required to be an ""animal lover"" to be a part of our group. (Although, if you are an animal lover, we'd be more than happy to have you. 😄) We think that the moral arguments for ending oppression and suffering, wherever they occur, shouldn't be arbitrarily restricted to members of our own species, and you don't have to be someone who enjoys the company of animals or someone who is fascinated by animals to be an advocate for them. We accept anyone into our organization regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, ability, background, and personal dietary choices.

The big question: ""why can't the climate & diversity committee just handle it?"" As academics, we need to personally engage with our racial identities and incorporate a sense of responsibility to action into our lives and work.

"Artisan Collective, The","The Artisan Collective is dedicated to changing lives and building relationships. We are unique in the mutual partnership we have between students, educators, and our global partners. As a student organization, we are committed to maintaining Fair Trade practices with the global artisans we collaborate with in order to make an impact economically, socially, and environmentally.
  Global Partners 

The University of Wisconsin- Madison that has spent many years building relationships with artisans at several global health field course sites. While working with these sites, we realized the opportunity gap that these artisans face. They are creating upscale, beautiful products that there is no demand for in their communities. Through realizing this, we wanted to create avenues to sell their products in the United States, allowing these artisans the opportunity to generate more income than they would be able to through selling solely at their local markets. 

We collaborate with artisans from 3 global communities: La Calera, Ecuador, Jalisco, Mexico, and Katmandu, Nepal. These artisans have few opportunities to participate in revenue generating activities. While they have the resources and skills to create beautiful and indigenous designs, the artisans are not aware of the current demands and trends in the United State's fashion market.

Students and Educators 

This is where the students and staff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come in. The School of Human Ecology (SoHE) is proud to offer a class titled, ""Global Artisans: Design and Sustainability,"" where students collaborate online with our international partners to design new, higher end products that will generate increased sales and income for these artisans. There is also a “Consumer Strategy & Evaluation” course, which works with the Wisconsin Union to decide how to best promote and sell the products at the Robin’s Nest Cafe, which is located in SoHE. 

The operations, marketing, finances, and sales of the products are organized by the student organization, The Artisan Collective. The student leadership of this group focuses on developing business plans for sustainable models to expand product sales opportunities from local art fairs to wholesale opportunities. Our inventory is purchased directly from the artisans, allowing them to generate much needed income for education, health care, and food. All revenue generated in Madison will be used to operate the project, develop new products, and expand to new sites.","theartisancollective.org@gmail.com","https://www.theartisancollective.org/","No Instagram available"

  Mission Statement
The CaSP Organization has three main goals:
Educate graduate students about science policy and emphasize the importance of increasing scientist participation in science policy issues, both local and national.
Increase graduate student awareness of various science policy careers and provide opportunities to help them become better candidates for these positions.
Communicate science topics of current relevance to government and funding agencies to the non-scientist Madison community.
  Science policy is a broad field that requires a general understanding of science, but also how policies are established in the government, private and nonprofit sectors. There is a lack of understanding of what science policy is and how it affects both public policy and scientific research. In order to fulfill our goal of educating students about science policy, we will have public seminars where invited speakers will present on various aspects of science policy. In addition, we wish to keep our student members updated on current science policy issues by holding meetings where we informally discuss these issues in a journal club setting. Being in the capital provides us with an amazing opportunity to work with senators and law makers. We hope to organize a relationship with the capital that affords graduate students the opportunity to meet policy makers and understand how policies involving science are managed and implemented from the policy makers’ perspective.
In order to increase the awareness of science policy as a career, several seminars with invited and local speakers will be organized during the year. Through these seminars the graduate student community will be exposed to different careers and jobs in different sectors: government, private and non-profit.  
Science policy issues affect scientists and the general public alike. For this reason, we believe that it is important for the public to understand the value of research and science.  To address this goal, we will reach out to the community and educate them on currently relevant science topics.  Through activities geared toward the non-scientific community, both in the local neighborhoods and on the University campus, we hope to demonstrate why the research done by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is important to the community at large. These activities will provide our members with experience communicating science topics to a general audience.  Non-technical communication is a skill that is indispensable for scientists, especially those interested in science policy, where scientists frequently interact with a variety of non-scientific audiences.","casp.uw@gmail.com","https://casp.wisc.edu/","No Instagram available"

We also can provide students with baking kits so that they can braid and bake challahs in their own kitchens. Some weeks will have themes or activities associated with them, such as embroidering challah covers, painting pumpkins, knitting, and other activities.
Holding these weekly baking meetings gives individuals the opportunity to disconnect from all the deadlines and obligations of a college student’s life and destress while focusing on baking with friends for one hour of the week, regardless of their religious identity or background. In addition to serving as a time for mental wellness, Challahbration serves as a social event, where students can easily meet members of the Jewish community or any members of the Madison community who share a love for challah baking. Baking challah weekly creates a community around Jewish values and provides the opportunity for students to preserve traditions from their childhood with the observance of Shabbat. In light of the Jewish value of Tzedakah, our weekly challah bakes are a source of food security for attendees. Furthermore, after students and Shabbat dinner have been provided for, any remaining challah will be donated to food banks in the area.","jbmanders@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/challabration/contact","No Instagram available"

"Chi Omega - Nu Chapter","Founding Purposes
• Friendship 
• Personal integrity 
• Service to others 
• Academic excellence and intellectual pursuits 
• Community and campus involvement 
• Personal and career development
  Motto
To live constantly above snobbery of word or deed; to place scholarship before social obligations and character before appearances; to be in the best sense, democratic rather than “exclusive”, and lovable rather than “popular”; to work earnestly, to speak kindly, to act sincerely, to choose thoughtfully that course which occasion and conscience demand; to be womanly always; to be discouraged never; in a word, to be loyal under and all circumstances to my Fraternity and her highest teachings and to have her welfare ever at heart that she may be a symphony of high purpose and helpfulness in which there is no discordant note.
  Community Service & Philanthropies
      Make-a-Wish Foundation became Chi Omega's national philanthropy in 2002 and since then Chi Omega has become the largest contributor to Make-a-Wish. Chi Omega holds a philanthropy event every fall called “Walk It Out For Wishes,” an event involving Wish children from the Madison area, the community and the chapter women. In the fall of 2018, the women of Chi Omega raised $35,000 and granted five wishes. All proceeds go directly to the Foundation.
      Each year our Chi Omega holds ‘Celebration for Shona’ as its spring philanthropy, in honor of Shona Goorvich. Shona was a member of Chi Omega who passed away from complications due to cancer when she was 19 years old. The women of Chi Omega put on a children’s carnival and spend the day at the UW Children’s Hospital, providing relief to the patients and their families. Chi Omega members and families also raise money for the Shona Goorvich Foundation, which was put in place by her family to donate money to programs which provide psychosocial support to children or teenagers with life threatening illnesses.
    Chi Omega also hosts “Chi O Reads Aloud” every Friday afternoon, volunteering in a Madison area after school program, providing homework help, classroom assistance, and spreading energy. 
    Awards

"Chi Psi Fraternity - Alpha Iota","Alpha Iota of Chi Psi, more commonly known on campus as ‘The Lodge’, has grown into one of the premier fraternities at the University of Wisconsin. One of the longest continuously active fraternities on campus, the Lodge has become a staple of the University and the city of Madison since its founding in 1878. Generations of men look back at their experiences at 150 Iota Ct. as some of the most memorable times in their lives. We at the Lodge continually strive for development and enrichment in our active membership even today, instilling the feelings and traditions of previous members in our current active body.
Activity outside of the Lodge is strongly encouraged, and many members are involved on the UW campus and in the local community. Members serve on the IFC Executive boards, serve on student government, participate in pre-professional and academic societies, and participate in club athletics. Many events within the Lodge, prepared and developed by the brotherhood, help to break up the daily grind of academic life. These events include intramural sports teams as well as socials with sororities, all helping to instill valuable personal and life-long skills for our members. Moreover, the Lodge is a force in philanthropic work in the Madison community, from our volunteer efforts at Gio's Garden to the Iota Open golf outing, which has raised thousands of dollars for local charities. Additionally, the Lodge has been very successful in Humorology, having won raising the highest total of funds twice in recent years.
Known as ‘Alphas’ of Chi Psi, Alpha Iota has long list of distinguished alumni including the great American historian Stephen E. Ambrose, renowned Milwaukee architect Andrew C. Eschweiler, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, the Pabst family from Pabst Brewing Co., and Daily Show producer Ben Karlin. Today, members come from across the country and world finding fraternity life at the Lodge one of the best parts of their college experience.
In many ways, the fraternity experience has drifted astray from its founding principles: bettering men and assisting them in the development of their intellectual, moral and social life. These values are what The Lodge is built upon, where we stress the importance of academic excellence, community service, and social tact. We are continually building a better experience for men who seek more out of their University years than the average undergraduate, and we’re searching for a select group of excellent young gentlemen to contribute to that experience.","zpolis@wisc.edu","http://chipsi.org","No Instagram available"

"Chinese Students and Scholars Association at UW-MADISON, The","More than 20 years from its foundation, Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) has doubtlessly established itself as the most active and influential Chinese student organization on the UW-Madison campus. We take great pride in our contribution to the promotion of the cultural exchange between Chinese culture and other cultures, as well as the promotion of the cultural diversity of the Madison community. From the first day it was founded, CSSA has aimed to build a prosperous community that will consist of not only Chinese students and scholars, but also those with other ethnic backgrounds who have an interest in Chinese tradition and culture.

After years of endeavors by the founders and the successors, CSSA has become the leading group in promoting the Chinese culture and tradition. Take the gala of the Spring Festival as an example. This annual event, which is open to all UW-Madison students and faculty for free, consisting of various kinds of shows, such as traditional and modern dances, singing and talk show. It has been held successfully for more than 20 years at the Memorial Union of the UW-Madison. This event has become so popular that the Chinese students, scholars, and their families have long taken it for granted as an opportunity for union and feast. Nowadays, more and more U.S families enjoy this annual show; many of them even participate in the performances. Other traditional activities of CSSA include the celebration of
Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as the Moon Festival).

There is no doubt that these activities have benefited the Chinese people by adding to their life excitement and communal feelings. By showcasing Chinese culture and tradition, they also, and maybe more importantly, benefited the Madison community as a whole. It should be specially noted, however, that we have not made these achievements all alone. Instead, we owe many thanks to several university administration offices, such as Associated Students of Madison, International Student and Scholar Services, and Registered Student Organization Office, and many other local organizations and individuals, such as Madison Chinese Language Society, to name a few.","kkwok4@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/cssauwmadison/contact","https://www.instagram.com/cssa_at_uwmadison/"

"Collegiate 4-H, UW-Madison","Collegiate 4-H, UW-Madison shall strive to follow the national motto: “Continuing to Serve, Serving
to Continue."" We will serve the needs of our members, Wisconsin 4-H, and the students of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison in any way we can. We will help build the future leaders of 4-H
through experience in the 4-H program on campus and across the state. Additionally we will follow
the 4-H motto, “To Make the Best Better.”
4-H is the nation’s largest youth development and empowerment organization. In Wisconsin, more than 150,000 young people in urban, suburban, and rural settings are involved with 4-H and other UW-Madison Division of Extension youth programs. Youth ages 5-19 can learn important life skills like leadership, teamwork, critical thinking and communication to help prepare them for successful futures – and they do it while engaging in fun, hands-on 4-H activities. Wisconsin 4-H Youth Development’s nearly 13,000 adult volunteers serve as mentors and role models for 4-H’ers. They help provide a safe, interactive place for youth to take risks, practice their independence, and master new skills. Adults who volunteer for 4-H take a lot away from their experiences – volunteers learn and strengthen skills that help them in the workplace and become better connected to their communities.
Collegiate 4-H has agreed on a partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding with UW-Madison, Division of Extension Wisconsin 4-H organization. We will be guided by both UW-Madison RSO policies and Wisconsin 4-H policies. We have been granted permission to use the 4-H emblem and logo, as well as have been assigned an advisor from the Wisconsin 4-H office.

In the interim, the Executive Board, consisting of elected and appointed members, acts to establish and implement policies, as needed. A paid professional staff, under the leadership of the Executive Director, operates the National Headquarters office in Washington, D.C.

EWB-UW was established in 2003 under the guidance of the late Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Peter Bosscher, who helped the chapter to develop a program in Muramba, Rwanda. Now in its 21st year of operation, the once small student chapter has expanded to over 200 active members and maintains a minimum five-year commitment to five communities, making ours the largest chapter of Engineers Without Borders in the United States.

EWB strives to educate globally conscious and internationally responsible engineers and students. We embody the Wisconsin Idea by not only performing engineering and social services in the state of Wisconsin, but by providing engineering and social services to communities around the globe.

Our chapter currently works in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Uganda, and Puerto Rico. Ours is a true partnership with our host communities, and community participation is crucial to the success of our projects. Communities play an active role in project selection and exhibit complete control over our projects.

We have coaches who volunteer their time to help us with skills and competitions but are not there to teach you how to skate. Additionally, we ask that all club members have their own skates. This is because we cannot guarantee that rental skates will be available during our practices. If you cannot meet these requirements but are still interested in skating, we recommend that you sign up for Learn to Skate classes through RecWell or a local ice rink.

In 1990, UW-Madison students who were in a Tagalog course began organizing “Tagalog sa Teresa” (“Tagalog at the Terrace”) sessions to engage the Filipino community in Madison. In the fall of 1991, 15 of these Tagalog students officially founded FASO at UW-Madison. These 15 students were considered the largest Southeast Asian language class at the time. These students wanted to connect with all Tagalog students on campus and others interested in learning the Filipino language and culture.
FASO has since become an active and very visible student organization on and off of the UW-Madison campus, facilitating numerous events and participating in programs with other university student organizations across the Midwest. FASO facilitates biweekly general body meetings, monthly magkasamas (cultural learning events), an annual Philippine Cultural Night, fundraisers, and much more!

The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.The prototype race car is judged in a number of different events. The points schedule for most Formula SAE events is:
Design Event 150
Cost & Manufacturing Analysis Event 100
Presentation Event 75
Acceleration Event 75
Skidpad Event 50
Autocross Event 150
EfficiencyEvent 100
Endurance Event 300
Total Points Possible 1,000

History
The Indian Graduate Students Association (IGSA) was established in 1996 by a group of graduate students from India at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with the aim of bringing Indian culture to the UW-Madison campus. We are a voluntary non-profit organization registered with the student organization office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the span of eighteen years we have grown into an organization with over 1400 members. Our members belong to different backgrounds and age groups. Membership to our organization is open to all.
  Nature of Activities
Music and dance concerts: We invite renowned artists and performers belonging to different schools and genre of Indian classical music and dance to perform at UW-Madison. Most of the artists we invite are recipients of several national and international awards. These artists could be instrumentalists or vocalists belonging to either of the two main schools of Indian music, Hindustani and carnatic. Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus.
Outdoor trips: We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin. The popularity of this event is shown by the rising numbers every year. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to be a part of a truly Wisconsin experience. We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin.

Social & cultural events: We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine.

Voluntary service to new students: We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle.

"Japanese Karate Club - UW Madison","Welcome to the Japanese Karate Club page!  
  If you are interested in joining, please log onto DoSportsEasy and join our roster! We don't use WIN to track our membership.
  We practice Shotokan Karate, the traditional form of Karate.  At practices, we learn kihon (techniques), kata (forms), and kumite (sparring).  Whether you are actively interested in competing, or simply want to work out, we would love to have you join our community!
  Our practice schedule:
For current practice hours and upcoming events, please visit our web site at https://mjks.madcitykarate.com
  *Please follow all COVID guidelines while attending events and in-person practice
All practices will continue to be broadcast virtually on Jitsi this semester if you aren't comfortable coming in person!
About us
The Japanese Karate Club practices the traditional Shotokan karate style. Instruction is given from the most basic level and increases in difficulty as the students learn the techniques required to control their body and mind. All three traditional components of karate training (kata, kihon, and kumite) are taught at the dojo. You do not need to have prior experience in martial arts - our instructors teach you everything starting from white belt. 
While the instruction centers on karate as a martial art, portions of the training involve self-defense applications and karate as a competitive sport. Our club regularly sends teams of men and women to regional and national collegiate competitions.
Our Affiliation
The Japanese Karate Club is affiliated nationally with the American Amateur Karate Federation, and internationally with the Japan Karate Association International and the World Traditional Karate Federation. All ranking is done under their auspices. Club members regularly attend clinics at the main dojos of the Great Lakes and North Central Regions of the AAKF.
Participation
Participation is open to all students, faculty, and staff. Members are not required to come to all practices, however, average attendance of once or twice a week is usually necessary for consistent advancement in rank. Most members try to attend as frequently as their class schedule permits.
Fun fact!
Our club has been a University of Wisconsin-Madison sports club since 1976 and the current head instructor is Vassil Peytchev, a Sandan (third degree black belt). Instruction is also performed by other regionally qualified first, second, and third degree black belt instructors.

"Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. (Beta Omicron Chapter)","Kappa Alpha Psi was founded on the campus of Indiana University on January 5, 1911. The Fraternity's fundamental purpose is achievement.
Early in this century, African-American students were actively dissuaded from attending college. Formidable obstacles were erected to prevent the few who were enrolled from assimilating into co-curricular campus life. This ostracism characterized Indiana University in 1911, thus causing Elder W. Diggs, Byron K. Armstrong, and eight other black students to form Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which remains the only Greek letter organization with its 1st Chapter on the University's campus.

The founders sought a formula that would immediately raise the sights of black collegians and stimulate them to accomplishments higher than they might have imagined.
Fashioning achievement as it's purpose, Kappa Alpha Psi began uniting college men of culture, patriotism and honor in a bond of fraternity.","fiifiscann@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/bokappaalphapsi/contact","http://instagram.com/bonupes1946"

MISSION: To guide men on a lifelong discovery of authenticity and personal growth.
VISION: A world where Lambda men live authentic, fulfilling lives and contribute through the pursuit of their noble purpose.
CORE VALUES:
Authenticity: Demonstration of one’s true self to the world, despite external expectations.
Courageous Leadership: Integrity through action towards a more humane world, especially in times of adversity.
Cultural Heritage: Ideas and experiences of a people, transcending the world through generations.

History: Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981 on the campus of UCLA by a group of nineteen dedicated men led by principal founder Mr. Craig Ishigo. The goal of the founders was to transcend the limitations faced by traditional Asian American interest organizations on campus. While these organizations were often split along lines of national origins, the founders sought an establishment that drew its membership equally from the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision was that the members would eventually become the leaders of their respective ethnic communities, and thus, bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common organization.","lphie.wisconsin@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/wisconsinlphie/contact","https://www.instagram.com/wiscolphie/"

"MadHatters Men's A Cappella","The MadHatters, based out of Madison, Wisconsin, are the premier men’s a cappella group of the UW campus. Founded in 1997, the MadHatters were the first of its kind at UW and have seen their humble beginnings boom into sold-out shows across campus filled with adoring fans. Comprised of 11 singers and a vocal percussionist, the MadHatters croon the songs of decades past to the Top 40 present.

Built on the foundation of goofy guys making good music and bringing fun to the community, the MadHatters have achieved much success in their short life. From filling the seats at Madison’s historic Orpheum Theatre and acclaimed Overture Centre to singing the National Anthem at a sold-out Brewers/Cubs rivalry at Miller Park, to traveling across the United States and Mexico, the MadHatters seem to have their world on a string and their opportunities endless.

The MadHatters have one live and six studio albums and are working on their seventh studio recording to be released later this year. Their first album released in 2002, State Street, had a track earn a spot on the 2002 Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) CD and is credited as the first a cappella album recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Their second album, 2004’s Friday After Class, exploded their fan base, becoming a “best seller” on a cappella website worldwide. Not For Credit, their third studio release was produced in 2007 and received two national recording awards, including another BOCA inclusion with “I Believe (When I Fall in Love).”
With their unmistakable attire in their Wisconsin red jackets, the MadHatters are a presence on the UW campus that brings everyone to clap their hands and stomp to the beat. Not only does the audience enjoy the show, but the MadHatters love performing it. Whether it be another sold-out show in Madison or singing at your grandma’s 80th birthday party, the MadHatters bring the fun wherever they go.
They’ll dance, they’ll shout (shout!) and they’ll shake your bodies down to the ground. They are the MadHatters.

"Matriculate, UW-Madison Cohort","Matriculate is a national non-profit that trains college students to act as mentors to low-income, high achieving high school students
Our Program Model 
We train talented college students at top institutions to connect remotely with high-achieving, low-income high school students, providing the information, guidance, and support that these high school students need to navigate the college process. 
College student Advising Fellows leverage the power of peer-to-peer interaction and social networks to fill the holes in how these students approach applying to college. Advising Fellows serve both as guides in the application process as well as models of matriculation, having successfully enrolled in top colleges themselves.
Each Advising Fellow commits to working remotely with up to four high-achieving, low-income high school students through the college application and selection process. College students apply for and, if selected, then earn the opportunity to serve as Advising Fellows. Advising Fellows are trained and assessed on their ability to play this role effectively.
Advising Fellows work with high school juniors and seniors from across the country – from Hawaii to West Virginia. Matriculate works with high school students who have an annual household family income under $80,000, a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and have scored in the 90th percentile on the PSAT, SAT or ACT.
Personal interactions between high school students and college students serve as the catalyst to shatter low-income high-achievers’ college perception gap.
Commitment is 5-6 hours a week during peak application season, and during the rest of the year advising fellows can work with their high school students to decide how much time they need.","ilclark@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/matriculate/contact","https://www.instagram.com/matriculateuw/"

To improve the criminal justice system by involving the community, through volunteer service, in the process
To provide a safe and constructive environment for diverse people to come together, share, and learn from one another
These goals are achieved through a number of targeted activities:
Weekly volunteer rotations through two Dane County jails located in downtown Madison.

Monthly processing parties.  Every month, Pages for Progress volunteers meet to prepare newly purchased or donated materials to be circulated into the City-County Building and Public Safety Building.

  What is PLA?
The Peer Learning Association (PLA) is a professional student organization that coordinates free guided group study sessions that supplement your specific course. All sessions are led by members of our organization (Peer Facilitators) who have completed that course with an exceptional grade. In these sessions, students have the opportunity to challenge their understanding of course material by presenting their knowledge of key topics to their peers in an informal classroom setting. Peers teach one another, and facilitators assist the conversation when necessary. Lecture Managers, who meet weekly with your professor, compose weekly outlines tailored to the key topics most recently covered in your class. Students can use PLA sessions as part of their normal study routine.

How do these sessions look?
Sessions are composed of about 5-20 peers/students (subject to change according to student demands per semester) and 1-2 Facilitator(s). Facilitators facilitate discussion of the course material presented by the obtained weekly outlines in a form of questions and peers will have prepared for these sessions beforehand in order to carry out the discussion among one another. Peers will be teaching peers and facilitators are there as an extra resource if the group becomes stuck on a particular subject of their discussion.

Phi Delta Chi will strengthen its Brothers in serving the community and driving the evolution of the pharmacy profession.  Each Brother will exemplify responsibility for sustained involvement in Phi Delta Chi throughout their lifetime.

LEADER-DEVELOPMENT
Phi Delta Chi places importance on the growth of individuals and the collective Brotherhood through social, personal, and leadership opportunities, beginning with fraternal education and continuing throughout our professional careers.

"Phi Delta Theta-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter","Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven’t budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded by “The Immortal Six” way back in 1848 at Miami University. The pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude.
Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person’s true self, and by learning from each other’s strengths while helping to improve each other’s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal expectations.","oaakinleye@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/phideltatheta/contact","https://www.instagram.com/phideltwisconsin/?hl=en"

"Phi Kappa Sigma - Alpha Theta Chapter","Alpha Theta is over 100 years old and one of the oldest Phi Kappa Sigma chapters. We regained our charter on April 19, 2008, and are beginning to record a new page in the history books of Phi Kappa Sigma at UW-Madison. We prefer to do things differently. For example, along with a typical chapter house, we have an 1800 sq. ft property called ""The Crypt"" on West Washington Avenue where we hold meetings, study, and hang out.
Additionally, we focus on personal and professional development. Phi Kappa Sigma looks for those who are dedicated to improving themselves and the community through an enriching experience in academics, service, and leadership. These traits can all be seen in Phi Kappa Sigma’s mission statement: “We exist to integrate scholastic excellence; community enrichment; and principled, effective leadership among reputable men. Through both fellowship and fraternity, our members persistently endeavor towards their individual and collective aspirations. Ultimately, we recruit, develop and yield 'Men of Honor.'"" 
Subsequently, our graduates have been very successful. Since re-chartering in 2008, our alumni went on to jobs/internships at Tesla, Apple Inc., The White House, Target Corporation, General Mills, SC Johnson, Caterpillar, MLB.com, Teach for America, EPIC Systems, Google LLC, and more! Recent graduates also attended the University of Michigan Medical School and UCLA Law School.
Nationally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a democratic national structure where undergraduates vote on and make decisions on issues at our national convention every two years. Additionally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a non-discrimination clause, allowing men of any race, religion, and social class to join our organization. Brothers believed that brotherhood was more than skin deep.
Furthermore, Phi Kappa Sigma is the only fraternity to have a college established in their name: Phi Kappa Sigma Male College, founded in 1859 in Monticello, Arkansas. Lastly, our national organization gives out over $60,000 in scholarships each year, more than any other fraternity.","Bparry@wisc.edu","https://linktr.ee/pksuw","No Instagram available"

"Pi Tau Sigma-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter","Pi Tau Sigma is an international honor society of top Juniors and Seniors in Mechanical Engineering. There are over 160 chapters from universities across North America. It was co-founded by our chapter in 1915 with four basic goals:
To foster high ideals in the engineering profession
To stimulate and support departmental activities
To promote professional welfare
To develop leadership and citizenship
History:
With the twentieth century came the realization that honor societies made a definite contribution to the department and that membership required active participation. Pi Tau Sigma came into being on March 16, 1915, at the University of Illinois. A similar organization embarked November 15, 1915, at Wisconsin and other local organizations (such as the Carzeuran of Purdue) were soon to become active.
The early leaders: Professors C.R. Richards, A.C. Willard, and O.A. Leutwiler of the University of Illinois; G.L. Larson of the University of Wisconsin; G.A. Young of Purdue University; and J.V. Martenis of the University of Minnesota, stand out for their early contributions.
In ten years Pi Tau Sigma grew to six chapters in the middlewest (Illinois Alpha, Wisconsin Alpha, Purdue Beta, Minnesota Gamma, Illinois Delta, and Missouri Epsilon). In 1925 the expansion continued to the east with the Penn State Zeta Chapter being installed. Six years later the Texas Kappa Chapter, and the following year the Colorado Mu Chapter established chapters in the south and west. Also in 1932 the expansion continued southeast to Georgia Tech Nu Chapter. It was not until nine years later that the first chapter was installed on the Pacific coast (Oregon State Omega). In twenty-six years Pi Tau Sigma became truly a national mechanical engineering honor society with a total of twenty-five chapters. During the succeeding four years nine additional chapters were installed.
From 1947 to 1958 forty new chapters were installed. The Chapter-At-Large was established in 1954. The installations completed thus far bring the total established chapters to one hundred and fifty-seven.
O.C.K. Hutchinson, University of Illinois, and J.B. Wilkinson, University of Wisconsin, met early in 1916 to arrange plans for making the organization national, under the name of Pi Tau Sigma. The coalition took place in Chicago, March 12, 1916, at which the matter if chapter designation was decided and the two chapters become Illinois Alpha and Wisconsin Alpha.","pitau@cae.wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/pitausigma/contact","http://www.instagram.com/pitausigmauw/"

"Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacy Student Interest Group","The primary objectives of our student interest group are the following: Educational opportunities, community outreach and service, mental health and wellness promotion and pharmacist career exploration. On the foundational level of our operations we are focusing on providing members of our interest group with educational opportunities to learn about current topics in psychiatric and neurological pharmacy. These educational opportunities are sourced from local experts in the field as well as faculty at the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy. We provide these educational opportunities through student interest group meetings and faculty led journal clubs.
              Coupled with educational opportunities, we conduct community service and outreach projects to advance pharmacists’ involvement in psychiatric and neurological conditions. Our student group strongly feels that one of the biggest barriers that patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions face is a lack of awareness of their conditions. Therefore, we partner with community organizations with existing outreach infrastructure to provide advocacy and patient support for those with psychiatric and neurological conditions.
              Part of our mission as future pharmacists working in this field is to promote mental health & wellness for our members as well as the entire School of Pharmacy. We play a pivotal role in putting on wellness week each year as well as posting articles, self care tips, and other information to promote well being to our wellness wall and brochures around the school.
              To give back to our member base, we provide networking and career exploration opportunities. We accomplish this by networking with local pharmacists involved with psychiatric and neurologic pharmacy and coordinating shadowing opportunities. Further, we use various student interest group meetings to bring in current psychiatric and neurological pharmacists to discuss their role in patient care.","khong5@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/pnpsig/contact","https://www.instagram.com/pnsig_uw"

"SAE Clean Snowmobile Team- IC","The SAE International Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) is an engineering design competition for college and university student members that challenge engineering students to reengineer an existing snowmobile to reduce emissions and noise. Their modified snowmobiles will compete in a variety of events including emissions, noise, fuel economy/endurance, acceleration, handling, static display, cold start and design.
The CSC Rules Committee makes changes to the competition each year to keep the competition fresh and to present new engineering challenges. CSC is primarily an ""engine"" competition however the underlying theme has remained consistent to engineer a clean and quiet trail sled. Current trail sleds are engineered to these standards, but it is possible to achieve more. Noise levels can be reduced, and cleaner fuels can lead to lower emissions.

"Sales & Trading and Asset Management Club","STAM’s goal is to find a group of highly passionate and motivated students pursuing careers in Sales & Trading and Asset Management and place its students at financial institutions. Based on the experience of the primary contacts for this organization, recruitment for these positions in New York and Chicago is highly selective. To be successful, a student not only must learn the financial aspect, but also must engage in arduous networking and extra-cirricular work to demonstrate an intellectual curiosity toward the subject. Based on conversations with numerous alumni, they are only able to help so much – a student must also demonstrate they are polished and educated enough to be successful in an internship position. 
Club members will develop in two ways: professionally and subject-specific. With the help of alumni (who are eager to help this organization), students will spend time improving networking skills and participate in outside case-studies to get a first-hand education.
At each weekly meeting (running 1 hour to 1.5 hours), half the time will be spent for each development purpose. Professional development will consist of resume editing, communication improvement, emailing practices, and do’s/dont’s of networking. The latter half of each session will consist of a discussion of weekly market movements (Dow, S&P, and commodities) and the drivers behind the movements. We will go through sell-side research reports and publish our own findings based on real-world data.
Students will also take the free Bloomberg Market Concepts course in the library to enhance their understanding for the markets. As the semester progresses, we will be speaking with alumni in S&T and Asset Management about their work/experiences, and get their perspectives on the markets to further enhance the education of our members.
During winter break sophomores  will travel to New York City and Chicago to meet with the sales and trading and asset management divisions across numerous banks.

"Shorin-Ryu Karate Club","About the Club
TL;DR:
Update: As of the end of the Fall 2024 semester the club has disbanded and will no longer be meeting. Thank you to all of our members!
If you are looking to learn self defense, or just a fun way to get fit, show up at any of our practice sessions! Your first semester is entirely free of charge!
As of Fall 2023, we've moved our roster from WIN to DoSportsEasy. Register for the club here!
When we meet
This Fall 2024, we'll meet at the Bakke Recreation & Wellbeing Center Tuesdays in the Classroom from 8-10 pm, as well as Saturdays in Tempo Studio from 10am-12pm. Come by any time, no experience is necessary!
Who we are
Shorin-Ryu Karate is a club sport that has been teaching students martial arts skills since 1972. Currently we have several Senseis (teachers), many of whom are students and staff at the university. Students in this class come from all walks of life, sharing the common desire to study a martial art. The ultimate goals of this dojo are to teach personal self-protection skills, improve physical fitness, share the rich history of the Shorin-Ryu martial arts, and to create a learning environment for self-mastery.
A typical class...
During a typical class, students start with some warm-up drills and body-weight fitness exercises, then practice a wide variety of techniques through kata (drills) and bunkai (practical applications).We utilize individual drills, partner drills, and group drills.
Sometimes, we engage in light to moderate contact and kobudo, or the ancient weapons of karate like bo, sai, nunchaku, tonfa etc. 
Training Philosophy
The study of kata is central to the martial arts, and a fundamental part of our curriculum. Kata are the forms which illustrate how individual techniques are put together to defend ourselves if ever the need should arise. The kata, which may be interpreted as a sequence of simple offensive techniques (e.g. punching, grappling, throwing etc.), have more subtle interpretations. The Okinawan masters who studied this art developed pressure point and joint manipulations that allow a karateka to control a much larger opponent. Our dojo studies these techniques, and integrates them into an effective personal self-defense system.
Typically, new students participate in learning pressure point methods and joint locks right away. Our first three kata are readily accessible to new students. Rank is not based strictly on how long a student has studied martial arts, but rather by ability to perform kata and explain bunkai (applications). On average, a new student can assimilate the entire introductory curriculum within one or two semesters. This represents proficiency at basic techniques and selected kata.
Advanced students may study the kobudo, or the ancient weapons as training devices, although emphasis is still placed on the effective use of empty hands (kara-te) to defend oneself. Additionally, advanced students earn teaching responsibilities. A student's training culminates in his or her black belt test, which represents proficiency in karate. Really, however, the black belt is only a beginning of another journey, into the great breadth and depth of the martial arts.
Summary
Teaching tangible self-defense skills in a friendly, collegiate atmosphere, Shorin-Ryu Karate Club draws on the strength of its members to enhance the martial arts experience. Although we pride ourselves on training in the traditional Okinawan skills, we also incorporate modern methods into our training to assure the best class content possible. We attend a few local tournaments, and individuals are encouraged to explore seminars that come to the Chicago area. Since we associate with a second Shorin-Ryu dojo (located at the YMCA), we enjoy a great sharing of knowledge, skill and camaraderie. We are always happy to welcome new members.","shorinryukarateclub82@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/shorin-ryu-karate-club/contact","No Instagram available"

"Sigma Chi - Lambda","In 1855, seven young men, Benjamin Piatt Runkle, Thomas Cowan Bell, William Lewis Lockwood, Isaac M. Jordan, Daniel William Cooper, Franklin Howard Scobey and James Parks Caldwell, wanted something better in a fraternity during their collegiate experience, and from that recognition, a dream was born — the fraternity of Sigma Chi.
In short, Sigma Chi began because good men chose to act.
Our seven Founders recognized that a principle-driven lifestyle should be paramount in an individual’s lifelong quest to achieve progressive development, and that the world in which they lived had a great need for ethical leaders whose core principles were based on the possession of remarkable character.
Sigma Chi’s story has been building on itself since 1855 and, indeed, the Fraternity has changed dramatically since that time. When those seven college students gathered together for the first time, there were no telephones, no automobiles, no planes, no Internet, not even electricity — essentially, their lives were devoid of any of the modern amenities we are used to. Yet, somehow, they prospered.
Without iPhones, the Internet, rapid transit, or even the possibility of an immediate connection outside of the small town of Oxford, Ohio, and their roughly 300 fellow students, they somehow knew that they had planted the seed for something amazing to grow. Through it all, they found in themselves and each other an uncommon strength of character to pursue a dream and to pass that dream on to other young men who would carry it forward.
Their dream was simple — to enhance the leadership abilities of men by refining their character through the framework of Friendship, Justice and Learning — our three guiding principles.
Seven young men set the foundation for a lifelong course of development that has since provided more than 300,000 men with the structure to understand how to make a positive influence on the world.
The ranks of Sigma Chis now include titans of industry, celebrities, political leaders, husbands, fathers, brothers and many more. Each member brings so many different characteristics to the world, yet we all bring the same endowment of character that our world today so badly needs.
Principle-driven leaders are needed now more than ever before, and the fact that Sigma Chi makes a concerted effort to contribute to the development of such men is what makes the Fraternity so important today.","SigmaChiWisconsin@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/sigma-chi_lambda-chapter/contact","https://www.instagram.com/sigmachiwisconsin/https://www.instagram.com/sigmachiwisconsin/"

"Steel Bridge Team of the University of Wisconsin-Madison","The National Student Steel Bridge Competition is an annual competition amongst approximately 200 schools across North America which challenges engineering students to design, fabricate, and build a 1:10 scale steel bridge that conforms to the specifications laid out in the competition rules. These rules change each year to keep the competition fresh and exciting. Bridges are scored at competitions based on Construction Economy and Structural Efficiency. The goal is to build a bridge that is strong, light, and easy to put together.
The fall semester is spent designing the bridge using the popular structural analysis program SAP2000. Team members are taught the fundamentals of the program during meetings, and are encouraged to assist in the design of the bridge. We also utilize the TEAM Lab to fabricate our own member connections, and many team members complete the requirements for obtaining their ""Intro to Machining"" training, allowing them access to the shop.
After the structural design is complete, the bridge is drawn in AutoCAD and a complete plan set is created. The plans are then brought to a local manufacturing company over winter break, who generously helps members fabricate the bridge for one week in January.
Spring semester is spent modifying the bridge and practicing construction runs. One of the goals of the competition is to put the bridge, which is fabricated in pieces, together as fast as possible. We spend months practicing so that we are as fast as possible at competitions.
The team competes in a regional competition, typically in early April, and hopefully a national competition in June. This year, our regional event will be in Chicago between UIC and IIT, and nationals are at Brigham Young University. The UW-Madison team has been very successful, competing in the national competition 20+ years in a row.
This year we are looking for lots of new members to assist in the design, fabrication and construction our bridge. We have lofty goals set for this school year and we are going to need a lot of involvement to achieve them. If you are interested in joining, please contact us via e-mail at steelbridgeuw@gmail.com or attend one of our meetings.

"Taekwondo Club - UW Madison","If you wish to join our club please register HERE. We can no longer add people to the roster on WIN. Thank you!
About Taekwondo:
Taekwondo is a martial art which emphasizes kicking and hand techniques from an upright, highly mobile stance. Developed in Korea, and practiced by over 7 million people worldwide, it is also a highly competitive Olympic Sport. 
We are the official Taekwondo Club of UW-Madison. As an official Sport Club, our competition team represents UW-Madison at various local and regional tournaments as well as the National Collegiate Taekwondo Championship. However, we do not require members to compete. Every year we have many students join who are simply looking to learn a fun new sport, make friends, and get in shape.
We are affiliated with the World Taekwondo Federation (the Olympic) style Taekwondo. We are taught by very experienced instructors, drawn from University staff and the student body. All of our instructors are Kukkiwon certified black belts and most of them have cross trained in multiple martial arts. Our instructors work hard to balance a traditional approach to martial arts training and the dynamic, quick, and explosive kicking style of full-contact Olympic sparring. Beyond the striking elements of Taekwondo, our club also emphasizes throws, breakfalls, joint-locks, and other techniques necessary to a well rounded self defense and martial arts program.
We also provide opportunities for students to get involved on campus and in the local community through fundraising for charities, volunteering at our self-defense seminars, and much more. 
Our Mission: 
The mission of the Taekwondo Club of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to instruct members in the techniques and tenets of Taekwondo; to provide opportunity for competitive members to represent the university at an elite level; and, to facilitate an environment where member growth positively impacts the team, the university, and the community. Inherent to this mission is a commitment to the spirit of collegiate athletics.

"Teatro Decimo Piso","Manifesto:
  Teatro Décimo Piso is a Hispanic theater group dedicated to keeping alive the heritage of performance in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. As aficionados of theater, one of our primary goals is to bring written scripts to life so that we can experience both the practical elements and the academic elements of the theater. We hope to grow a community of spectators within our department and to foster collaboration among our colleagues. As members of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and the Interdisciplinary Theatre Program, we also aim to take Hispanic theater and the community that we have created outside the walls of the tenth floor of Van Hise Hall. Décimo Piso was established in August 2012 by graduate students of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. We work collectively and equally as members of the group and choose leadership roles like director, assistant director, producer, etc. democratically. This creates a very communal and representative dynamic. The group welcomes students of all areas of study to participate. Currently, its members come from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and the Interdisciplinary Theatre Studies Program, and we welcome the entire undergraduate and graduate student body to participate. Advanced undergraduates, faculty members, or interested community members are also welcome to take part in the group.
  Though in prior years the group has mainly read and produced plays in Spanish, we are open to reading and producing works in Portuguese, Catalan, U.S. Latino, or other languages. We have produced works from Spanish and Latin American playwrights, and works ranging from the 17th to the 21st centuries. This breadth demonstrates our commitment to explore pieces from all geographical regions and time periods in Hispanic culture. In past years, the group has met to read out loud and discuss short works of theater in the Fall semester before choosing one or two to produce in the Spring semester. In the present, we will remain committed to our theatrical practice as we simultaneously engage with a research-oriented approach to what theatre and performance mean in the Hispanic and Luzo-Brazilian worlds through our first annual talk series.","agebarski@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/teatro10piso/contact","www.instagram.com/teatrodecimopiso"

We provide opportunities to learn more about the nuances of entrepreneurship and product development as well as events to meet other creative students you normally would never run into on campus who may very well become your next co-founders.

Our community is a great platform for…
Learning how to transition from idea to reality
Brainstorming ideas and vetting good from bad
Solving a real business’s problem during our problem-solving soirees
Meeting other creative students with bold ideas
Pitching your idea to the group for feedback
Meeting an engineering student who can do 3d modeling

Finding your Innovation Days partner
Meeting area entrepreneurs
Get your project personally reviewed by professors, entrepreneurs & investors
And more?!? We’re open to any meeting idea in the spirit of ‘collaboration, creativity and product-building’
    A note about Intellectual Property and collaborating in Transcend:
Intellectual Property is a catch-all term for the creative work you have done – idea drawings, engineering designs, program specifications, business model, the ‘how it works’ part of your idea. We want you to protect your IP while still being open to sharing ideas and collaboration.
We have no set policy regarding non-disclosure agreements or keeping things secret. We want you to share your idea. If you’re afraid of the idea getting taken, then you don’t have to share your entire ‘secret sauce’ recipe with everyone. In other words, Ford could have talked about his ‘assembly line’ idea without getting into the details of creating one. To create conversation and brainstorming, you only need to describe at a very high-altitude view what you’re doing, not the nitty gritty details. You can save your IP while being open about your ideas – it is possible. And in today’s knowledge economy, the only way to collaborate is by sharing ideas.
No idea can be 100% original and uninfluenced by prior ideas. If someone ‘steals’ your idea, it probably means they are using parts of your idea, parts of prior ideas and parts of their own ideas to make something that is much different than your original intention. That’s the spirit of creativity! Sharing ideas and sparking other product ideas.
If you decide to work with other students, you control that relationship 100% and should talk about IP sharing and what you think is acceptable. At this point you should reach out to the UW Law & Entrepreneurship clinic which gives free legal advice (and told us to tell you they want to hear your ideas!).","vmandadi@wisc.edu","http://transcenduw.com","No Instagram available"

"Turning Point USA Chapter at UW-Madison","Turning Point USA starts conversations among young people, by educating students about fiscal responsibility, free markets, and capitalism. Through non-partisan debate, dialogue, and discussion, Turning Point USA believes that every young person can be enlightened to true free market values.
  WE BELIEVE: In Balanced Budgets
A country, business, or family should not spend more money than it takes in. High debts ruin economic potential, plague private investment, and jeopardize the future generations chance to enjoy prosperity.
  WE BELIEVE: In an Informed Electorate
The greatest solution to combating generational theft is an electorate that understands the issues, civics, and basic governmental policy. With a more informed electorate, old political talking points of the past will no longer be viable, candidates will be forced to stand behind their principles, and pressured to execute beneficial public policy.
  WE BELIEVE: In the Power of the Youth
With over 46 million younger voters eligible to vote in 2012 alone and millions more each year, younger generations are this country’s fastest growing demographic. If we do not target the youth, debts will become a thing of habit, and our republic forever lost.
  WE BELIEVE: In an Independent Approach
Turning Point USA does not stand on party, rather on principle. Both sides of the aisle are responsible for reckless spending and trillion dollar deficits. It is now time for a resurgent citizen force to take action against such politicians by educating the electorate about the theft that has been occurring.
  WE BELIEVE: That tomorrow is brighter
No matter how deep the hole, or gloomy the day, never bet against America. The power of freedom and liberty is a force that can overcome a government bureaucrat, agency, or even politician. The root of Turning Point USA is an optimistic approach, and the core belief that tomorrow will be more prosperous.
  Types of Events:
The Turning Point USA Chapter will be hosting speakers and debates to explore and understand free-market principles and current events.  We will also be participating in campus activism activities such as tabling and chalking.  The purpose of the activities is to spread awareness and knowledge about free markets, fiscal responsibility and capitalism.","hemadsen2@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/tpusamadison/contact","https://www.instagram.com/tpusa_uw/"

Why Vietnam?
More than three decades removed from the war, Vietnam still fights the battle against poverty due to postwar effects. Almost a third of the country lives under the poverty line with rates increasing in rural areas. With growing demand for quality healthcare, basic education, stable living conditions, and reliable infrastructure, Vietnam needs aid in order to provide its communities with a sustainable future.

"Wim Hof Club","Wim Hof Club (Hoffers) is based on three core principles: breathing, cold therapy, and commitment to mastering the mind. Based on the “Wim Hof Method,” our mission is to make individuals happier, healthier, and stronger, reawakening our forgotten inner human power: to adapt to extreme temperatures and survive within our natural environment. We accomplish this through guided breathing and meditation sessions, followed by cold or heat exposure (e.g. cold showers, lake plunges, or saunas). The tangible long term benefits of these practices are profound: increased energy, reduced stress levels, reduced inflammation, better sleep, heightened focus, improved athletic performance/recovery, and most notably, immunity to sickness. Need validation? Wim Hof, the founder of the method, holds 20 Guinness World Records for withstanding extreme temperatures. He climbed Everest and Kilimanjaro in only shorts and shoes, stayed comfortable in ice baths for hours, and ran a full marathon in the Namib desert (50 degrees celsius, 122 Fahrenheit) with no water or food. Wim understands the human body’s desire for nature, meditation, and discomfort, which explains his passion to veer a society away from an epidemic of depression and other mental illnesses. Phones and other technology lead to extreme comfort and luxury that our ancestors and evolution did not prepare us for. It is no surprise that rates of depression are skyrocketing as our society moves away from the way humans are supposed to live. We must reclaim our bodies, minds, and souls by striving for greater meaning in life rather than simply living a life of ease and, consequently, sadness. Come join us every week, rain, snow, or shine, at Memorial Union and seek discomfort with us!","jrsullivan9@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/wimhofclub/contact","https://www.instagram.com/hoffers_/?hl=en"

"Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative","The Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative (WBI) is an interdisciplinary group that brings students together to mitigate the increasingly prevalent threat posed by infectious disease.
  As evident by the historic COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases have the capacity to shut down societies: interrupting critical supply chains, destabilizing economies, and leading to massive loss of life.
While the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen considerably from its peak, additional, potentially even more lethal pandemics may be just around the corner - waiting to spill over from a non-human host, being stored in an insecure laboratory, or perhaps being created using increasingly available genetic engineering tools.
To prevent these pathogens from triggering the next global pandemic , experts in epidemiology, public health, biology, environmental science, medicine, law, and numerous other fields must collaborate closely to surveil pathogens, effectively manage outbreaks, develop vaccines, and respond promptly to emerging threats.
  Helping students get their start in these fields is the core of the Wisconsin Biosecurity Initiative which offers mentored research and project teams, a vast professional network, as well as internship, publishing and grant opportunities – our goal is to kickstart your career!","biosecuw@gmail.com","https://www.wiscobiosec.org/","No Instagram available"

  WHY CONSULTING?
Consulting firms are one of the biggest recruiters of top undergraduate students. With offices in almost every city around the world, the career opportunities are boundless and span every industry, function, practice, and sector. Consulting firms are a great place to develop your own brand, network with executives at very successful companies, and pursue your passions.
  Consulting will fast track your career and offers some of the best salaries of any position available to a recent graduate. Moreover, you will also have the added perks of traveling and potential sponsorship for your MBA.
  Most importantly, your time as a “student” does not stop once you begin your career as a consultant. Consultants a required to learn a lot of things, and learn them quickly. This intensive, yet diverse understanding of the world will enable you to tackle any challenge in your future career.  Furthermore, as a first year consultant you will be entrusted with very high profile projects that some of your peers may not encounter until they are well into their own careers. Above all, consulting firms invest a lot of money into you to make you the best you can possibly be. You will be a part of a large network of extremely talented and smart professionals who will help you along in your career.","wcc.communication@gmail.com","https://www.wisconsinconsultingclub.org/","No Instagram available"

The council’s purpose is to enrich the student experience for engineering students at the University of Wisconsin Madison while creating an open and welcoming environment for all Badger engineers. Through student driven events like E-Bash, an event devoted to showcasing the 50+ student orgs within the College of Engineering, WESC strives to make getting involved within engineering student organizations on campus as accessible as possible. While WESC promotes student activities on campus, they also hold professional development events to enhance the job seeking experience for engineering undergraduates. Hosting events like Professional Skills Week and Major Exploration Night has helped many students gain valuable insight into the professional world of engineering and connect with Badger engineering alumni.

"Wisconsin Equestrian Team","Wisconsin Equestrian is made up of a team of approximately 20 riders from all backgrounds and disciplines. Experience levels range from horse lovers who have never had the chance to take up riding to those who have been successful in the upper levels of equitation, hunters, and jumpers. Although the Wisconsin Equestrian Team rides and competes in hunt seat equitation, members of ALL disciplines are welcome and encouraged to tryout.
  Each member gets an average of 1 hour of riding time per week, and extra lessons can be scheduled with the Hoofer Riding Club. Wisconsin Equestrian Team uses the horses and facility of Sugar Creek Stables, located in Brooklyn, WI. It is not necessary to have a car in order to join the team as carpools are organized for every event including lessons, practices, socials, and horse shows. 
  The team provides a great social network as our season spans the entire school year, rather than just a semester. Wisconsin Equestrian also plans multiple social events throughout the year so everyone may get to know each other and create a bond of friendship and team competition. 
  Time Commitment
The time commitment for the Wisconsin Equestrian Team is a perfect balance between work and play, providing team members with several opportunities to ride while still maintaining plenty of time for their studies.
  Lessons
Team members are divided into lesson groups of maximum 4-5 people and take one-hour long lesson a week with a coach. If the coach must cancel a lesson due to an emergency or unsafe weather conditions, the lesson will be rescheduled for a later date in the semester. If a rider misses their lesson, they are responsible for making it up on their own. Lessons are held at Sugar Creek Stables.
* For lessons, riders must commit additional time to groom and tack up horses before the scheduled riding time and untack and cool down horses after. This usually adds an additional hour to lessons.
  Transportation
Sugar Creek Stables is located in Brooklyn, WI, which is about 40 minutes away from the UW-Madison Campus. Team members carpool to the barn for lessons and practices, so owning a car is not necessary.
  Horse Shows
Wisconsin Equestrian competes in approximately ten horse shows throughout the school year. These are generally held across five weekends. As riders continue to improve and show dedication to the team, show teams will change throughout the school year. Therefore, not every team member will compete at every show.
  Social Events
Meetings are held on Wednesdays at 7 PM bi-weekly. Our social chairs also organize at least one social event per month in order to foster team bonding and friendship.
  Financial Commitment
The Wisconsin Equestrian Team does not receive sponsorship money from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Therefore, most of our funds come from fundraising efforts, the generous donations of friends and family members, and the pockets of our team members. In order to help future members prepare for the financial commitment of being on the team, we have put together a rough estimate based on costs from previous years. Please note that costs are subject to change throughout the year.
  Lessons: $35 each (Members are required to take 22 per year)
Hoofer Club Membership: $125 per year
IHSA Membership: $45 per year
Driver gas money (not applicable if you are a driver): approximately $50 per semester
Horse Shows: approximately $200 per weekend (Includes entry fees, hotel, food, and fleet rental)
  Of course, these expenses are spread out throughout both semesters, and payment plans are available to help alleviate financial concerns. This estimate does not include Tournament of Champions series horse shows, Regionals, Zones, or Nationals. The Wisconsin Equestrian Team participates in several fundraising events to help offset the costs of practices and horse shows.","bunderson@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/wisconsinequestrianteam/contact","https://www.instagram.com/badgerequestrian/"

With slight modifications, women's routines are judged based on Xcel Silver, Xcel Platinum, level 8, and level 9 USAG Junior Olympic Program Rules, while men's routines are judged based on FIG rules for modified level 7, level 9, and NCAA. Members of all skill levels are encouraged to compete. At the end of the spring semester, all members are encouraged to compete in the NAIGC Nationals competition, which will be held in Albuquerque, NM this year. To participate, you must compete in at least two other meets during the school year. Additional fees will apply for competition. 
                                                                                                                                                                      FUNDRAISING: Every year, the Wisconsin Gymnastics Club holds several fundraising events.

"Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society","The Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society grew out of two traditions: the University of Wisconsin Law School’s “law in action” approach and the interdisciplinary design of gender studies. Through “law in action” we look beyond the statutes and cases to study the practical effects of the law on individuals, marginalized communities, and society at large. The interdisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on gender identity, offers different perspectives through which to expand and challenge our understanding of the law and its implications on society.
The Journal, originally the Wisconsin Women’s Law Journal, one of the earliest in the nation devoted to the study of women and the law, has strived to contribute insightful scholarship to this evolving field of study. Recognizing that women are a diverse group with differing beliefs and interests, and moreover that gender stereotyping and gender identity discrimination of any kind inhibits each individual’s full equality under the law, we encourage articles that examine the intersection of law and gender with issues of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.","ccarey6@wisc.edu","http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wordpress/wjlgs/","No Instagram available"

We also encourage pre-business students or students with similar majors outside of the business school to join our organization to gain exposure to the opportunities that exist within the finance and accounting fields.

We collaborate with companies such as Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC, Wells Fargo, BMO Harris, JPMC, Forvis, Merrill Lynch all businesses through which we offer networking and volunteering events and professional development workshops. We aim to provide an organization that gives female students not only the confidence to succeed, but also the resources and knowledge they need to meet their goals and venture into their careers.","wisconsin.wifa@gmail.com","https://www.wisconsinwifa.com","No Instagram available"

"YesUW","YesUW is based on the principles of the YouTube Channel Yes Theory and the process of  seeking discomfort. We believe that the key to forming deeper connections and creating more fulfilling experiences require stepping outside our comfort zones. By going outside our comfort zones, we can see new perspectives and shake us out of our daily lives. Doing so reminds  us that our day to day routine isn’t the only thing that is out there. As Yes Theory says, “Break out of your routine, and you’ll find new creative energy.” These change-ups allow us to see the world in a new light and can inspire new ideas. The only issue with trying new experiences is that they can be uncomfortable. We sit in our day to day lives thinking why go out and try something new, that seems like so much work. It's easy to find a million reasons to say no, it’s hard to say yes.
  And yet, we find ourselves bored with that day to day life. To find fulfillment, we have to go outside our comfort zones. We want to be the facilitator for these experiences so that  everyone who is inspired will be able to seek discomfort and fulfillment on a regular basis.","atschirtzinger@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/yesuw/contact","https://www.instagram.com/yes.uw/"
