"Adventist Christian Fellowship - Madison","Hey there, we are so glad you've visited our page!
We are UW-Madison students who at some point in our lives started to ask deep questions and wonder about God and such things, and then experienced that God is actually a loving and good God, and, thus, we really want to share with others the life-changing power of the Bible here, on campus, in our busy, everyday lives, which can be full of problems, worries, and struggles.
Why is it cool?) The acronym ""ACF"" explains it very well, though it may seem hard to understand at first:
A - Adventist. Adventists emphasize that the imminent second coming (""advent"") of Jesus gives hope to each one of us because this will be the day when our whole life, regardless of how it was, can be made perfect, and we can become fully happy, just as God planned it to be.
C - Christian. Christians know that Jesus loved each person, each identity, and each individual so much, that He decided to give up everything (including His life) so that we may be restored, and our lives - fulfilled. This focus on His amazing love is something that can truly change your life and ours.
F - Fellowship. We all have a deep longing for a community and fellowship, and no one likes to feel alone or excluded, though this often happens on such a big campus as ours. But when we get to know God's love, we are so filled with it that we naturally tend (and are able) to share this gift with our community, while being focused on Jesus. No community becomes more united than the one where God is at the center.
  Still wondering what all these words like ""God's love"", ""fulfillment"", ""true community"" or ""belonging"" mean?
Come and join our next event, and you'll figure it out!

"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc (R) - Epsilon Delta Chapter","Founded on Wednesday January 15, 1908 on the campus of Howard University in Washington D.C., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated ® is the first Greek Letter Organization to be established and nationally incorporated by college-trained African American women. 
The purpose of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. is to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of service all mankind. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter became the First Black Sorority on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, as well as the first Undergraduate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in the state. Given the small number of Black students enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Saturday May 18, 1968, the presence of a Black sorority on this campus made a very important statement. 
The Epsilon Delta Chapter was and still is involved in promoting Black unity and Black heritage on campus, as well as providing service to the University Wisconsin-Madison and Madison communities. Through our programming and service initiatives, this powerful legacy of ‘Being of Service to all Mankind’ proudly continues today, and we continue to do it with ‘Style and Grace’

The American Medical Women’s Association empowers women to lead in improving health for all within a model that reflects the unique perspective of women.
MISSION
The American Medical Women’s Association is an organization which functions at the local, national, and international level to advance women in medicine and improve women’s health.  We achieve this by providing and developing leadership, advocacy, education, expertise, mentoring, and strategic alliances.
BACKGROUND
The American Medical Women’s Association (AMWA) is an organization of women physicians, medical students and other persons dedicated to serving as the unique voice for women’s health and the advancement of women in medicine. The organization was founded by Dr. Bertha VanHoosen in 1915 in Chicago, at a time when women physicians were an under-represented minority. As women in medicine increase in numbers, new obstacles arise that were not anticipated. AMWA has been addressing these issues for 95 years.

"Animal Advocacy UW–Madison","Subscribe to our Mailing List
  Our organization's goal is to help students identify the best ways of helping animals through education and facilitating connections with professionals both in the animal advocacy space and in the alternative proteins industry. We want to create a safe space where people interested in the well-being of animals can come together as a community regardless of dietary choices or beliefs.
  In addition to social events, a core part of our programming is the Animal Ethics Fellowship in which members are split into groups and a facilitator guides them through a curriculum over the course of 5–8 weeks. The curriculum covers topics such as moral circle expansion, veganism, animal advocacy as a social justice issue, the pros and cons of the field of ""effective animal advocacy,"" invertebrate welfare, and wild animal welfare.
  It's not required to be an ""animal lover"" to be a part of our group. (Although, if you are an animal lover, we'd be more than happy to have you. 😄) We think that the moral arguments for ending oppression and suffering, wherever they occur, shouldn't be arbitrarily restricted to members of our own species, and you don't have to be someone who enjoys the company of animals or someone who is fascinated by animals to be an advocate for them. We accept anyone into our organization regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, ability, background, and personal dietary choices.

"Antiracism Learning and Action in Neuroscience","In light of the longstanding national movement to dismantle systemic racism, a number of neuroscience graduate students and faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison formed a small learning-action group  committed to racial justice in our spaces and communities .

  Why this is important
The big question: ""why can't the climate & diversity committee just handle it?"" As academics, we need to personally engage with our racial identities and incorporate a sense of responsibility to action into our lives and work. We have an obligation to critically evaluate the academic spaces we occupy - our labs, departments, societies, and universities, and actively work towards inclusion and dismantling systems of privilege within them.

I have always loved sports, and I want to bring a club to UW that highlights the impact that new technologies have on the sports world, and allow other sports fans to learn and take part in this community. With technology and AI continuously taking a bigger part in sports, we will breakdown different examples of its use, including player performance analysis, game strategy, fan engagement, and discuss its effect on the economy.","aiseuw@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/aiseuw/contact","No Instagram available","No image available"
"Artisan Collective, The","The Artisan Collective is dedicated to changing lives and building relationships. We are unique in the mutual partnership we have between students, educators, and our global partners. As a student organization, we are committed to maintaining Fair Trade practices with the global artisans we collaborate with in order to make an impact economically, socially, and environmentally.
  Global Partners 

The University of Wisconsin- Madison that has spent many years building relationships with artisans at several global health field course sites. While working with these sites, we realized the opportunity gap that these artisans face. They are creating upscale, beautiful products that there is no demand for in their communities. Through realizing this, we wanted to create avenues to sell their products in the United States, allowing these artisans the opportunity to generate more income than they would be able to through selling solely at their local markets. 

We collaborate with artisans from 3 global communities: La Calera, Ecuador, Jalisco, Mexico, and Katmandu, Nepal. These artisans have few opportunities to participate in revenue generating activities. While they have the resources and skills to create beautiful and indigenous designs, the artisans are not aware of the current demands and trends in the United State's fashion market.

Students and Educators 

This is where the students and staff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come in. The School of Human Ecology (SoHE) is proud to offer a class titled, ""Global Artisans: Design and Sustainability,"" where students collaborate online with our international partners to design new, higher end products that will generate increased sales and income for these artisans. There is also a “Consumer Strategy & Evaluation” course, which works with the Wisconsin Union to decide how to best promote and sell the products at the Robin’s Nest Cafe, which is located in SoHE. 

The operations, marketing, finances, and sales of the products are organized by the student organization, The Artisan Collective. The student leadership of this group focuses on developing business plans for sustainable models to expand product sales opportunities from local art fairs to wholesale opportunities. Our inventory is purchased directly from the artisans, allowing them to generate much needed income for education, health care, and food. All revenue generated in Madison will be used to operate the project, develop new products, and expand to new sites.","theartisancollective.org@gmail.com","https://www.theartisancollective.org/","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/4a268df6-61a1-441f-8258-1e82d132198b3cc01913-3330-42e5-8941-645b38754c3e.png?preset=small-sq"

Aside from offering great opportunities for our members, we do our best to preserve the hunting heritage of America, and specifically of Wisconsin.  We are active in promoting and sponsoring Learn to Hunt programs for novice hunters, teaching hunter safety classes, and exposing non-hunters to the joys and benefits of hunting. We try to portray hunting in a different light in order to break down some of the stereotypes people have about hunting by being active in habitat conservation, as well as viewing hunting as a means of acquiring sustainable, organic meat. Also, we are very active in helping our property owners manage their properties through providing working parties and helping out as needed.

"BridgeMadison","BridgeUSA is a multi-partisan student movement that champions viewpoint diversity, responsible
discourse, and a solution-oriented political culture. We are developing a generation of leaders
that value empathy and constructive engagement because our generation will bear the cost of
polarization and tribalism for years to come.
We believe that polarization is damaging our country and causing young people to either
disengage from democracy or radically engage by fitting a partisan mold. Democracy is in
danger if the next generation is disengaged and polarized because young people are the future
of our country.
The purpose of BridgeUSA is to build a BridgeUSA community — one in which students from
across the ideological spectrum can engage as a group working together to understand — to
bridge — the various perspectives behind the important political and social issues of our time.
We rise above party. We do not force unity or compromise. We believe in the BridgeUSA Mindset:

  Mission Statement
The CaSP Organization has three main goals:
Educate graduate students about science policy and emphasize the importance of increasing scientist participation in science policy issues, both local and national.
Increase graduate student awareness of various science policy careers and provide opportunities to help them become better candidates for these positions.
Communicate science topics of current relevance to government and funding agencies to the non-scientist Madison community.
  Science policy is a broad field that requires a general understanding of science, but also how policies are established in the government, private and nonprofit sectors. There is a lack of understanding of what science policy is and how it affects both public policy and scientific research. In order to fulfill our goal of educating students about science policy, we will have public seminars where invited speakers will present on various aspects of science policy. In addition, we wish to keep our student members updated on current science policy issues by holding meetings where we informally discuss these issues in a journal club setting. Being in the capital provides us with an amazing opportunity to work with senators and law makers. We hope to organize a relationship with the capital that affords graduate students the opportunity to meet policy makers and understand how policies involving science are managed and implemented from the policy makers’ perspective.
In order to increase the awareness of science policy as a career, several seminars with invited and local speakers will be organized during the year. Through these seminars the graduate student community will be exposed to different careers and jobs in different sectors: government, private and non-profit.  
Science policy issues affect scientists and the general public alike. For this reason, we believe that it is important for the public to understand the value of research and science.  To address this goal, we will reach out to the community and educate them on currently relevant science topics.  Through activities geared toward the non-scientific community, both in the local neighborhoods and on the University campus, we hope to demonstrate why the research done by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is important to the community at large. These activities will provide our members with experience communicating science topics to a general audience.  Non-technical communication is a skill that is indispensable for scientists, especially those interested in science policy, where scientists frequently interact with a variety of non-scientific audiences.","casp.uw@gmail.com","https://casp.wisc.edu/","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/cbe2206b-a154-402d-9fc8-d5e89c22f81c952d781b-bd87-4d91-82ed-ea4e5895b7c0.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"CHAARG at University of Wisconsin--Madison","CHAARG aims to ignite a passion in college-aged girls for health + fitness. Too many college girls rely solely on an elliptical. CHAARG liberates girls from the elliptical + shows them that fitness can [+ SHOULD] be fun! Since every girl has a different preference of what fun is, we create opportunities for our CHAARG girls to “find their fit.” We do this by partnering with local studios once a week to lead a workout, whether it be CrossFit, Pure Barre, or salsa dancing — and everything in between.
Once a girl joins CHAARG, she is welcomed into a supportive + empowering community of girls from all over the country-- not just at Madison! When you workout, you feel good — but, when you surround yourself with people to support you, you feel even better. CHAARG combines good friends + a good workout to keep every girl feeling her happiest + healthiest self.

"Challabration","Challabration is a club that is devoted to creating a community around baking challahs and other desserts weekly in preparation for Shabbat. Every Thursday during the semester, the University of Wisconsin Hillel will provide dough for students to braid, incorporating the flavor of the week, as well as supplying the ingredients for the dessert of the week which will be served for Shabbat dinner at Hillel the following night. Once students have made their challahs and desserts, we will bake their creations, and students can choose to stay and eat their baked goods fresh out of the oven, take them home, or pick them up the following day. We also can provide students with baking kits so that they can braid and bake challahs in their own kitchens. Some weeks will have themes or activities associated with them, such as embroidering challah covers, painting pumpkins, knitting, and other activities.
Holding these weekly baking meetings gives individuals the opportunity to disconnect from all the deadlines and obligations of a college student’s life and destress while focusing on baking with friends for one hour of the week, regardless of their religious identity or background. In addition to serving as a time for mental wellness, Challahbration serves as a social event, where students can easily meet members of the Jewish community or any members of the Madison community who share a love for challah baking. Baking challah weekly creates a community around Jewish values and provides the opportunity for students to preserve traditions from their childhood with the observance of Shabbat. In light of the Jewish value of Tzedakah, our weekly challah bakes are a source of food security for attendees. Furthermore, after students and Shabbat dinner have been provided for, any remaining challah will be donated to food banks in the area.","jbmanders@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/challabration/contact","No Instagram available","No image available"

"Chi Omega - Nu Chapter","Founding Purposes
• Friendship 
• Personal integrity 
• Service to others 
• Academic excellence and intellectual pursuits 
• Community and campus involvement 
• Personal and career development
  Motto
To live constantly above snobbery of word or deed; to place scholarship before social obligations and character before appearances; to be in the best sense, democratic rather than “exclusive”, and lovable rather than “popular”; to work earnestly, to speak kindly, to act sincerely, to choose thoughtfully that course which occasion and conscience demand; to be womanly always; to be discouraged never; in a word, to be loyal under and all circumstances to my Fraternity and her highest teachings and to have her welfare ever at heart that she may be a symphony of high purpose and helpfulness in which there is no discordant note.
  Community Service & Philanthropies
      Make-a-Wish Foundation became Chi Omega's national philanthropy in 2002 and since then Chi Omega has become the largest contributor to Make-a-Wish. Chi Omega holds a philanthropy event every fall called “Walk It Out For Wishes,” an event involving Wish children from the Madison area, the community and the chapter women. In the fall of 2018, the women of Chi Omega raised $35,000 and granted five wishes. All proceeds go directly to the Foundation.
      Each year our Chi Omega holds ‘Celebration for Shona’ as its spring philanthropy, in honor of Shona Goorvich. Shona was a member of Chi Omega who passed away from complications due to cancer when she was 19 years old. The women of Chi Omega put on a children’s carnival and spend the day at the UW Children’s Hospital, providing relief to the patients and their families. Chi Omega members and families also raise money for the Shona Goorvich Foundation, which was put in place by her family to donate money to programs which provide psychosocial support to children or teenagers with life threatening illnesses.
    Chi Omega also hosts “Chi O Reads Aloud” every Friday afternoon, volunteering in a Madison area after school program, providing homework help, classroom assistance, and spreading energy.

"Chi Psi Fraternity - Alpha Iota","Alpha Iota of Chi Psi, more commonly known on campus as ‘The Lodge’, has grown into one of the premier fraternities at the University of Wisconsin. One of the longest continuously active fraternities on campus, the Lodge has become a staple of the University and the city of Madison since its founding in 1878. Generations of men look back at their experiences at 150 Iota Ct. as some of the most memorable times in their lives. We at the Lodge continually strive for development and enrichment in our active membership even today, instilling the feelings and traditions of previous members in our current active body.
Activity outside of the Lodge is strongly encouraged, and many members are involved on the UW campus and in the local community. Members serve on the IFC Executive boards, serve on student government, participate in pre-professional and academic societies, and participate in club athletics. Many events within the Lodge, prepared and developed by the brotherhood, help to break up the daily grind of academic life. These events include intramural sports teams as well as socials with sororities, all helping to instill valuable personal and life-long skills for our members. Moreover, the Lodge is a force in philanthropic work in the Madison community, from our volunteer efforts at Gio's Garden to the Iota Open golf outing, which has raised thousands of dollars for local charities. Additionally, the Lodge has been very successful in Humorology, having won raising the highest total of funds twice in recent years.
Known as ‘Alphas’ of Chi Psi, Alpha Iota has long list of distinguished alumni including the great American historian Stephen E. Ambrose, renowned Milwaukee architect Andrew C. Eschweiler, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, the Pabst family from Pabst Brewing Co., and Daily Show producer Ben Karlin. Today, members come from across the country and world finding fraternity life at the Lodge one of the best parts of their college experience.
In many ways, the fraternity experience has drifted astray from its founding principles: bettering men and assisting them in the development of their intellectual, moral and social life. These values are what The Lodge is built upon, where we stress the importance of academic excellence, community service, and social tact. We are continually building a better experience for men who seek more out of their University years than the average undergraduate, and we’re searching for a select group of excellent young gentlemen to contribute to that experience.","zpolis@wisc.edu","http://chipsi.org","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/b4b4eeda-34d3-4eec-9937-38bda0a30ef08743da6d-5c78-4547-af64-f231d2316fe5.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"Chinese Students and Scholars Association at UW-MADISON, The","More than 20 years from its foundation, Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) has doubtlessly established itself as the most active and influential Chinese student organization on the UW-Madison campus. We take great pride in our contribution to the promotion of the cultural exchange between Chinese culture and other cultures, as well as the promotion of the cultural diversity of the Madison community. From the first day it was founded, CSSA has aimed to build a prosperous community that will consist of not only Chinese students and scholars, but also those with other ethnic backgrounds who have an interest in Chinese tradition and culture.

After years of endeavors by the founders and the successors, CSSA has become the leading group in promoting the Chinese culture and tradition. Take the gala of the Spring Festival as an example. This annual event, which is open to all UW-Madison students and faculty for free, consisting of various kinds of shows, such as traditional and modern dances, singing and talk show. It has been held successfully for more than 20 years at the Memorial Union of the UW-Madison. This event has become so popular that the Chinese students, scholars, and their families have long taken it for granted as an opportunity for union and feast. Nowadays, more and more U.S families enjoy this annual show; many of them even participate in the performances. Other traditional activities of CSSA include the celebration of
Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as the Moon Festival).

There is no doubt that these activities have benefited the Chinese people by adding to their life excitement and communal feelings. By showcasing Chinese culture and tradition, they also, and maybe more importantly, benefited the Madison community as a whole. It should be specially noted, however, that we have not made these achievements all alone. Instead, we owe many thanks to several university administration offices, such as Associated Students of Madison, International Student and Scholar Services, and Registered Student Organization Office, and many other local organizations and individuals, such as Madison Chinese Language Society, to name a few.","kkwok4@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/cssauwmadison/contact","https://www.instagram.com/cssa_at_uwmadison/","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/d1c9ba8d-a9b4-412e-8927-16c7d0f40f3634a4ab91-6030-4f47-b00b-1a7e4fcb7067.png?preset=small-sq"

They help provide a safe, interactive place for youth to take risks, practice their independence, and master new skills.

To do so, we host seminars & networking events throughout the semester by faculty and professionals working on interdisciplinary, data-driven projects spanning sociology, finance, biology, public health, and many other fields. Together, we find and share the most effective resources for learning, then share or talk about them. We also perform walkthroughs of interesting data technologies like web-scraping with Python or using a Twitter API to gain actionable data. Moving forward, we would like to better network students with faculty, companies, and each other on new ventures, from Kaggle competitions to semester-long research projects to internships and jobs (and free food).","dotdatauw@gmail.com","http://dotdatascience.org/","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e8835a3b-ccca-409c-9826-130cf164bf42646fd962-8421-4dc8-a85f-0796626f4c82.png?preset=small-sq"

EWB-UW was established in 2003 under the guidance of the late Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Peter Bosscher, who helped the chapter to develop a program in Muramba, Rwanda. Now in its 21st year of operation, the once small student chapter has expanded to over 200 active members and maintains a minimum five-year commitment to five communities, making ours the largest chapter of Engineers Without Borders in the United States.

EWB strives to educate globally conscious and internationally responsible engineers and students. We embody the Wisconsin Idea by not only performing engineering and social services in the state of Wisconsin, but by providing engineering and social services to communities around the globe.

Our chapter currently works in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Uganda, and Puerto Rico. Ours is a true partnership with our host communities, and community participation is crucial to the success of our projects. Communities play an active role in project selection and exhibit complete control over our projects. Community ownership during the design process is important, but community ownership post-implementation is necessary in order to maintain our projects and to ensure that our projects fulfill their intended purpose.

"Equivalence Band","Equivalence Band is a dynamic and culturally driven musical group founded in late 2024 by Chinese students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison). The band’s name, “Equivalence,” reflects their core philosophy of fostering equal dialogue and fusion between Eastern and Western cultures—a theme deeply embedded in their music.

By blending elements from both traditions, the band creates a truly unique and immersive sound that resonates with diverse audiences.
More than just a musical endeavor, Equivalence Band was founded to celebrate and share the richness of Chinese culture. Their performances are not only about music but also about cultural exchange and connection. Whether through the powerful rhythms of rock or the delicate melodies of traditional Chinese music, Equivalence Band uses their passion and talent to bridge cultural divides, creating a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western musical traditions.
As a student-led band, Equivalence Band embodies the creativity and energy of the younger generation while carrying a deep sense of responsibility for cultural preservation and innovation.

  Though we do not have tryouts, we ask that team members have some background in skating. This is for safety reasons. We have coaches who volunteer their time to help us with skills and competitions but are not there to teach you how to skate. Additionally, we ask that all club members have their own skates. This is because we cannot guarantee that rental skates will be available during our practices. If you cannot meet these requirements but are still interested in skating, we recommend that you sign up for Learn to Skate classes through RecWell or a local ice rink.

"Filipinx American Student Organization","The Filipinx American Student Organization (FASO) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is a group of students deeply committed to the issues and experiences of Filipinx and Filipinx Americans. FASO aims to educate and spread awareness about Filipinx culture and history, foster friendships, and identify with each other through educational, cultural, and social events and programming. FASO is based on the spirit of Bayanihan; the values of family, community, and exploring one’s sense of self.
In 1990, UW-Madison students who were in a Tagalog course began organizing “Tagalog sa Teresa” (“Tagalog at the Terrace”) sessions to engage the Filipino community in Madison. In the fall of 1991, 15 of these Tagalog students officially founded FASO at UW-Madison. These 15 students were considered the largest Southeast Asian language class at the time. These students wanted to connect with all Tagalog students on campus and others interested in learning the Filipino language and culture.
FASO has since become an active and very visible student organization on and off of the UW-Madison campus, facilitating numerous events and participating in programs with other university student organizations across the Midwest. FASO facilitates biweekly general body meetings, monthly magkasamas (cultural learning events), an annual Philippine Cultural Night, fundraisers, and much more! FASO strives to be an inclusive student organization, and a family to all students.","fasomadison@gmail.com","https://fasomadison.square.site/","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/857f1b1f-59f9-416d-acc0-9eafe9508ac62e485977-335b-4aba-9d0a-8e2bbf2a155e.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"Formula SAE","Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE, also known as SAE International). The competition was started back in 1978 and was originally called SAE Mini Indy.
The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.The prototype race car is judged in a number of different events. The points schedule for most Formula SAE events is:
Design Event 150
Cost & Manufacturing Analysis Event 100
Presentation Event 75
Acceleration Event 75
Skidpad Event 50
Autocross Event 150
EfficiencyEvent 100
Endurance Event 300
Total Points Possible 1,000
  Formula SAE encompasses all aspects of a business including research, design, manufacturing, testing, development, marketing, management, and fundraising. Formula SAE takes students out of the classroom and puts them in the real world.

History
The Indian Graduate Students Association (IGSA) was established in 1996 by a group of graduate students from India at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with the aim of bringing Indian culture to the UW-Madison campus. We are a voluntary non-profit organization registered with the student organization office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the span of eighteen years we have grown into an organization with over 1400 members. Our members belong to different backgrounds and age groups. Membership to our organization is open to all.
  Nature of Activities
Music and dance concerts: We invite renowned artists and performers belonging to different schools and genre of Indian classical music and dance to perform at UW-Madison. Most of the artists we invite are recipients of several national and international awards. These artists could be instrumentalists or vocalists belonging to either of the two main schools of Indian music, Hindustani and carnatic. Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus.
Outdoor trips: We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin. The popularity of this event is shown by the rising numbers every year. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to be a part of a truly Wisconsin experience. We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin.

Social & cultural events: We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine.

Voluntary service to new students: We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle. We help students with temporary accommodation, and conduct several orientation programs for their benefit.","igsa.uw@gmail.com","https://linktr.ee/igsa_uwmadison","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/625af3d8-0e81-4ad5-86bb-3c279b005b9460f3e3b4-64a3-492d-9a07-5a4acd9a1605.png?preset=small-sq"

"Japanese Karate Club - UW Madison","Welcome to the Japanese Karate Club page!  
  If you are interested in joining, please log onto DoSportsEasy and join our roster! We don't use WIN to track our membership.
  We practice Shotokan Karate, the traditional form of Karate.  At practices, we learn kihon (techniques), kata (forms), and kumite (sparring).  Whether you are actively interested in competing, or simply want to work out, we would love to have you join our community!
  Our practice schedule:
For current practice hours and upcoming events, please visit our web site at https://mjks.madcitykarate.com
  *Please follow all COVID guidelines while attending events and in-person practice
All practices will continue to be broadcast virtually on Jitsi this semester if you aren't comfortable coming in person!
About us
The Japanese Karate Club practices the traditional Shotokan karate style. Instruction is given from the most basic level and increases in difficulty as the students learn the techniques required to control their body and mind. All three traditional components of karate training (kata, kihon, and kumite) are taught at the dojo. You do not need to have prior experience in martial arts - our instructors teach you everything starting from white belt. 
While the instruction centers on karate as a martial art, portions of the training involve self-defense applications and karate as a competitive sport. Our club regularly sends teams of men and women to regional and national collegiate competitions.
Our Affiliation
The Japanese Karate Club is affiliated nationally with the American Amateur Karate Federation, and internationally with the Japan Karate Association International and the World Traditional Karate Federation. All ranking is done under their auspices. Club members regularly attend clinics at the main dojos of the Great Lakes and North Central Regions of the AAKF.
Participation
Participation is open to all students, faculty, and staff. Members are not required to come to all practices, however, average attendance of once or twice a week is usually necessary for consistent advancement in rank. Most members try to attend as frequently as their class schedule permits.
Fun fact!
Our club has been a University of Wisconsin-Madison sports club since 1976 and the current head instructor is Vassil Peytchev, a Sandan (third degree black belt). Instruction is also performed by other regionally qualified first, second, and third degree black belt instructors.

"Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. (Beta Omicron Chapter)","Kappa Alpha Psi was founded on the campus of Indiana University on January 5, 1911. The Fraternity's fundamental purpose is achievement.
Early in this century, African-American students were actively dissuaded from attending college. Formidable obstacles were erected to prevent the few who were enrolled from assimilating into co-curricular campus life. This ostracism characterized Indiana University in 1911, thus causing Elder W. Diggs, Byron K. Armstrong, and eight other black students to form Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which remains the only Greek letter organization with its 1st Chapter on the University's campus.

The founders sought a formula that would immediately raise the sights of black collegians and stimulate them to accomplishments higher than they might have imagined.
Fashioning achievement as it's purpose, Kappa Alpha Psi began uniting college men of culture, patriotism and honor in a bond of fraternity.","fiifiscann@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/bokappaalphapsi/contact","http://instagram.com/bonupes1946","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/013144bd-7142-4a84-8f47-d4a07f9ebe220b04f43e-ab4f-4efd-b3db-ec87adc36601.jpg?preset=small-sq"

MISSION: To guide men on a lifelong discovery of authenticity and personal growth.
VISION: A world where Lambda men live authentic, fulfilling lives and contribute through the pursuit of their noble purpose.
CORE VALUES:
Authenticity: Demonstration of one’s true self to the world, despite external expectations.
Courageous Leadership: Integrity through action towards a more humane world, especially in times of adversity.
Cultural Heritage: Ideas and experiences of a people, transcending the world through generations.

History: Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981 on the campus of UCLA by a group of nineteen dedicated men led by principal founder Mr. Craig Ishigo. The goal of the founders was to transcend the limitations faced by traditional Asian American interest organizations on campus. While these organizations were often split along lines of national origins, the founders sought an establishment that drew its membership equally from the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision was that the members would eventually become the leaders of their respective ethnic communities, and thus, bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common organization.","lphie.wisconsin@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/wisconsinlphie/contact","https://www.instagram.com/wiscolphie/","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/85e7db07-68b0-4126-ba0a-316e17f627c24b71a7b9-98db-4c69-ac41-8373a658407e.png?preset=small-sq"

"MadHatters Men's A Cappella","The MadHatters, based out of Madison, Wisconsin, are the premier men’s a cappella group of the UW campus. Founded in 1997, the MadHatters were the first of its kind at UW and have seen their humble beginnings boom into sold-out shows across campus filled with adoring fans. Comprised of 11 singers and a vocal percussionist, the MadHatters croon the songs of decades past to the Top 40 present.

Built on the foundation of goofy guys making good music and bringing fun to the community, the MadHatters have achieved much success in their short life. From filling the seats at Madison’s historic Orpheum Theatre and acclaimed Overture Centre to singing the National Anthem at a sold-out Brewers/Cubs rivalry at Miller Park, to traveling across the United States and Mexico, the MadHatters seem to have their world on a string and their opportunities endless.

The MadHatters have one live and six studio albums and are working on their seventh studio recording to be released later this year. Their first album released in 2002, State Street, had a track earn a spot on the 2002 Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) CD and is credited as the first a cappella album recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Their second album, 2004’s Friday After Class, exploded their fan base, becoming a “best seller” on a cappella website worldwide. Not For Credit, their third studio release was produced in 2007 and received two national recording awards, including another BOCA inclusion with “I Believe (When I Fall in Love).”
With their unmistakable attire in their Wisconsin red jackets, the MadHatters are a presence on the UW campus that brings everyone to clap their hands and stomp to the beat. Not only does the audience enjoy the show, but the MadHatters love performing it. Whether it be another sold-out show in Madison or singing at your grandma’s 80th birthday party, the MadHatters bring the fun wherever they go.
They’ll dance, they’ll shout (shout!) and they’ll shake your bodies down to the ground. They are the MadHatters.
Thank you for your interest in the group - we'd love to see you at a show sometime soon!","madhattersuw@gmail.com","https://www.madhattersuw.org/","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/c70eb50d-80e1-4d7c-9466-9ff0286119e82f4a2b03-1758-48bf-b7b9-5d0c38cce06b.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"Matriculate, UW-Madison Cohort","Matriculate is a national non-profit that trains college students to act as mentors to low-income, high achieving high school students
Our Program Model 
We train talented college students at top institutions to connect remotely with high-achieving, low-income high school students, providing the information, guidance, and support that these high school students need to navigate the college process. 
College student Advising Fellows leverage the power of peer-to-peer interaction and social networks to fill the holes in how these students approach applying to college. Advising Fellows serve both as guides in the application process as well as models of matriculation, having successfully enrolled in top colleges themselves.
Each Advising Fellow commits to working remotely with up to four high-achieving, low-income high school students through the college application and selection process. College students apply for and, if selected, then earn the opportunity to serve as Advising Fellows. Advising Fellows are trained and assessed on their ability to play this role effectively.
Advising Fellows work with high school juniors and seniors from across the country – from Hawaii to West Virginia. Matriculate works with high school students who have an annual household family income under $80,000, a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and have scored in the 90th percentile on the PSAT, SAT or ACT.
Personal interactions between high school students and college students serve as the catalyst to shatter low-income high-achievers’ college perception gap.
Commitment is 5-6 hours a week during peak application season, and during the rest of the year advising fellows can work with their high school students to decide how much time they need.","ilclark@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/matriculate/contact","https://www.instagram.com/matriculateuw/","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/c8ce033c-8018-40bf-b41a-e427c3dc03250ad6a6ed-aacb-45e3-bb13-0e49c1986e6b.JPG?preset=small-sq"

Peer Sign Ups
Facilitator/Lecture Manager Sign Ups
If you indicate through the survey that you are interested in facilitating a session, you will be contacted soon. We regularly check this.
  What is PLA?
The Peer Learning Association (PLA) is a professional student organization that coordinates free guided group study sessions that supplement your specific course. All sessions are led by members of our organization (Peer Facilitators) who have completed that course with an exceptional grade. In these sessions, students have the opportunity to challenge their understanding of course material by presenting their knowledge of key topics to their peers in an informal classroom setting. Peers teach one another, and facilitators assist the conversation when necessary. Lecture Managers, who meet weekly with your professor, compose weekly outlines tailored to the key topics most recently covered in your class. Students can use PLA sessions as part of their normal study routine.

How do these sessions look?
Sessions are composed of about 5-20 peers/students (subject to change according to student demands per semester) and 1-2 Facilitator(s). Facilitators facilitate discussion of the course material presented by the obtained weekly outlines in a form of questions and peers will have prepared for these sessions beforehand in order to carry out the discussion among one another. Peers will be teaching peers and facilitators are there as an extra resource if the group becomes stuck on a particular subject of their discussion.

Our sense of Brotherhood goes beyond the collegiate level.  Brothers maintain communications and assist each other across the nation and throughout our careers.

"Phi Delta Theta-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter","Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven’t budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded by “The Immortal Six” way back in 1848 at Miami University. The pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude.
Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person’s true self, and by learning from each other’s strengths while helping to improve each other’s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to find young men to “mold” into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal expectations.","oaakinleye@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/phideltatheta/contact","https://www.instagram.com/phideltwisconsin/?hl=en","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/7242cd2c-42ce-47f0-b98d-8b6fbe218471c3423ded-cfbf-42ca-8725-99d467af2a1c.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"Phi Kappa Sigma - Alpha Theta Chapter","Alpha Theta is over 100 years old and one of the oldest Phi Kappa Sigma chapters. We regained our charter on April 19, 2008, and are beginning to record a new page in the history books of Phi Kappa Sigma at UW-Madison. We prefer to do things differently. For example, along with a typical chapter house, we have an 1800 sq. ft property called ""The Crypt"" on West Washington Avenue where we hold meetings, study, and hang out.
Additionally, we focus on personal and professional development. Phi Kappa Sigma looks for those who are dedicated to improving themselves and the community through an enriching experience in academics, service, and leadership. These traits can all be seen in Phi Kappa Sigma’s mission statement: “We exist to integrate scholastic excellence; community enrichment; and principled, effective leadership among reputable men. Through both fellowship and fraternity, our members persistently endeavor towards their individual and collective aspirations. Ultimately, we recruit, develop and yield 'Men of Honor.'"" 
Subsequently, our graduates have been very successful. Since re-chartering in 2008, our alumni went on to jobs/internships at Tesla, Apple Inc., The White House, Target Corporation, General Mills, SC Johnson, Caterpillar, MLB.com, Teach for America, EPIC Systems, Google LLC, and more! Recent graduates also attended the University of Michigan Medical School and UCLA Law School.
Nationally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a democratic national structure where undergraduates vote on and make decisions on issues at our national convention every two years. Additionally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a non-discrimination clause, allowing men of any race, religion, and social class to join our organization. Brothers believed that brotherhood was more than skin deep.
Furthermore, Phi Kappa Sigma is the only fraternity to have a college established in their name: Phi Kappa Sigma Male College, founded in 1859 in Monticello, Arkansas. Lastly, our national organization gives out over $60,000 in scholarships each year, more than any other fraternity.","Bparry@wisc.edu","https://linktr.ee/pksuw","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/3242811e-fb08-49d2-a923-906f6c8b7a862b194060-9f27-4066-8630-4db5833510f9.png?preset=small-sq"

"Pi Tau Sigma-Wisconsin Alpha Chapter","Pi Tau Sigma is an international honor society of top Juniors and Seniors in Mechanical Engineering. There are over 160 chapters from universities across North America. It was co-founded by our chapter in 1915 with four basic goals:
To foster high ideals in the engineering profession
To stimulate and support departmental activities
To promote professional welfare
To develop leadership and citizenship
History:
With the twentieth century came the realization that honor societies made a definite contribution to the department and that membership required active participation. Pi Tau Sigma came into being on March 16, 1915, at the University of Illinois. A similar organization embarked November 15, 1915, at Wisconsin and other local organizations (such as the Carzeuran of Purdue) were soon to become active.
The early leaders: Professors C.R. Richards, A.C. Willard, and O.A. Leutwiler of the University of Illinois; G.L. Larson of the University of Wisconsin; G.A. Young of Purdue University; and J.V. Martenis of the University of Minnesota, stand out for their early contributions.
In ten years Pi Tau Sigma grew to six chapters in the middlewest (Illinois Alpha, Wisconsin Alpha, Purdue Beta, Minnesota Gamma, Illinois Delta, and Missouri Epsilon). In 1925 the expansion continued to the east with the Penn State Zeta Chapter being installed. Six years later the Texas Kappa Chapter, and the following year the Colorado Mu Chapter established chapters in the south and west. Also in 1932 the expansion continued southeast to Georgia Tech Nu Chapter. It was not until nine years later that the first chapter was installed on the Pacific coast (Oregon State Omega). In twenty-six years Pi Tau Sigma became truly a national mechanical engineering honor society with a total of twenty-five chapters. During the succeeding four years nine additional chapters were installed.
From 1947 to 1958 forty new chapters were installed. The Chapter-At-Large was established in 1954. The installations completed thus far bring the total established chapters to one hundred and fifty-seven.
O.C.K. Hutchinson, University of Illinois, and J.B. Wilkinson, University of Wisconsin, met early in 1916 to arrange plans for making the organization national, under the name of Pi Tau Sigma. The coalition took place in Chicago, March 12, 1916, at which the matter if chapter designation was decided and the two chapters become Illinois Alpha and Wisconsin Alpha.","pitau@cae.wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/pitausigma/contact","http://www.instagram.com/pitausigmauw/","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e686f80e-1026-4c53-a08b-3cc98b653135e0fed6c3-61c0-4dce-b16a-a5bb1aac74eb.gif?preset=small-sq"

"Psi Chi Honor Society, UW-Madison Chapter","Psi Chi is the International Honor Society in Psychology, founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating, and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology. Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests and who meet the minimum qualifications (see below). 
Psi Chi serves two major goals: to provide meaningful academic recognition through membership, and offer a climate congenial to professional development. The UW-Madison Chapter offers practical experience by organizing programs designed to enhance the regular curriculum. Events from recent years include the annual graduate school informational panel, and presentations from university researchers and clinicians, allowing students to connect with a network of professionals in the field.
Currently, we are partnered with the Princeton Review. Through our partnership, Psi Chi members enjoy access to discounted prep courses (e.g., GRE, MCAT).
In addition to attending monthly Chapter meetings, all members are invited to actively participate in one of several committees, which immerse students in projects that foster fellowship, develop the Society, and serve the community. Currently there are five committees:
Newsletter/Journal Committee: This committee was reorganized in September, 2013 as part of an ongoing effort to rebrand our organization publication as a newsletter-journal hybrid. The publication aims to create opportunities for students by featuring student works and listing of professionals in psychology-related careers who have volunteered to take on students for career experience.
Community Service Committee: This committee organizes and promotes volunteer community outreach opportunities for all Society members.
Psych talks Committee: This committee recruits professionals in the field to give presentations at Chapter meetings throughout the year. For example, department faculty from all areas of concentration are invited to present current research and clinicians discuss clinical experiences. Students are encouraged to engage the presenters and are welcome to ask questions. Committee members also assist with the annual graduate student informational panel.
Fundraising Committee: This committee works to raise funds for Society activities and charitable organizations. Current fundraising activities include t-shirt sales and local restaurant benefits.

Initiation Committee: This committee advertises the organization, evaluates prospective members, and organizes the annual Induction Ceremony.","psichi_psych@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/psichi/contact","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/8818181b-11fd-49c0-b7ee-a387462d5ca5095a17b4-af2d-4959-9698-2b2531a494ca.jpg?preset=small-sq"
"Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacy Student Interest Group","The primary objectives of our student interest group are the following: Educational opportunities, community outreach and service, mental health and wellness promotion and pharmacist career exploration. On the foundational level of our operations we are focusing on providing members of our interest group with educational opportunities to learn about current topics in psychiatric and neurological pharmacy. These educational opportunities are sourced from local experts in the field as well as faculty at the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy. We provide these educational opportunities through student interest group meetings and faculty led journal clubs.
              Coupled with educational opportunities, we conduct community service and outreach projects to advance pharmacists’ involvement in psychiatric and neurological conditions. Our student group strongly feels that one of the biggest barriers that patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions face is a lack of awareness of their conditions. Therefore, we partner with community organizations with existing outreach infrastructure to provide advocacy and patient support for those with psychiatric and neurological conditions.
              Part of our mission as future pharmacists working in this field is to promote mental health & wellness for our members as well as the entire School of Pharmacy. We play a pivotal role in putting on wellness week each year as well as posting articles, self care tips, and other information to promote well being to our wellness wall and brochures around the school.
              To give back to our member base, we provide networking and career exploration opportunities. We accomplish this by networking with local pharmacists involved with psychiatric and neurologic pharmacy and coordinating shadowing opportunities. Further, we use various student interest group meetings to bring in current psychiatric and neurological pharmacists to discuss their role in patient care.","khong5@wisc.edu","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/pnpsig/contact","https://www.instagram.com/pnsig_uw","No image available"

"Sales & Trading and Asset Management Club","STAM’s goal is to find a group of highly passionate and motivated students pursuing careers in Sales & Trading and Asset Management and place its students at financial institutions. Based on the experience of the primary contacts for this organization, recruitment for these positions in New York and Chicago is highly selective. To be successful, a student not only must learn the financial aspect, but also must engage in arduous networking and extra-cirricular work to demonstrate an intellectual curiosity toward the subject. Based on conversations with numerous alumni, they are only able to help so much – a student must also demonstrate they are polished and educated enough to be successful in an internship position. 
Club members will develop in two ways: professionally and subject-specific. With the help of alumni (who are eager to help this organization), students will spend time improving networking skills and participate in outside case-studies to get a first-hand education.
At each weekly meeting (running 1 hour to 1.5 hours), half the time will be spent for each development purpose. Professional development will consist of resume editing, communication improvement, emailing practices, and do’s/dont’s of networking. The latter half of each session will consist of a discussion of weekly market movements (Dow, S&P, and commodities) and the drivers behind the movements. We will go through sell-side research reports and publish our own findings based on real-world data.
Students will also take the free Bloomberg Market Concepts course in the library to enhance their understanding for the markets. As the semester progresses, we will be speaking with alumni in S&T and Asset Management about their work/experiences, and get their perspectives on the markets to further enhance the education of our members.
During winter break sophomores  will travel to New York City and Chicago to meet with the sales and trading and asset management divisions across numerous banks.

If you are looking to learn self defense, or just a fun way to get fit, show up at any of our practice sessions! Your first semester is entirely free of charge!
As of Fall 2023, we've moved our roster from WIN to DoSportsEasy. Register for the club here!
When we meet
This Fall 2024, we'll meet at the Bakke Recreation & Wellbeing Center Tuesdays in the Classroom from 8-10 pm, as well as Saturdays in Tempo Studio from 10am-12pm. Come by any time, no experience is necessary!
Who we are
Shorin-Ryu Karate is a club sport that has been teaching students martial arts skills since 1972. Currently we have several Senseis (teachers), many of whom are students and staff at the university. Students in this class come from all walks of life, sharing the common desire to study a martial art. The ultimate goals of this dojo are to teach personal self-protection skills, improve physical fitness, share the rich history of the Shorin-Ryu martial arts, and to create a learning environment for self-mastery.
A typical class...
During a typical class, students start with some warm-up drills and body-weight fitness exercises, then practice a wide variety of techniques through kata (drills) and bunkai (practical applications).We utilize individual drills, partner drills, and group drills.
Sometimes, we engage in light to moderate contact and kobudo, or the ancient weapons of karate like bo, sai, nunchaku, tonfa etc. 
Training Philosophy
The study of kata is central to the martial arts, and a fundamental part of our curriculum. Kata are the forms which illustrate how individual techniques are put together to defend ourselves if ever the need should arise. The kata, which may be interpreted as a sequence of simple offensive techniques (e.g. punching, grappling, throwing etc.), have more subtle interpretations. The Okinawan masters who studied this art developed pressure point and joint manipulations that allow a karateka to control a much larger opponent. Our dojo studies these techniques, and integrates them into an effective personal self-defense system.
Typically, new students participate in learning pressure point methods and joint locks right away. Our first three kata are readily accessible to new students. Rank is not based strictly on how long a student has studied martial arts, but rather by ability to perform kata and explain bunkai (applications). On average, a new student can assimilate the entire introductory curriculum within one or two semesters. This represents proficiency at basic techniques and selected kata.
Advanced students may study the kobudo, or the ancient weapons as training devices, although emphasis is still placed on the effective use of empty hands (kara-te) to defend oneself. Additionally, advanced students earn teaching responsibilities. A student's training culminates in his or her black belt test, which represents proficiency in karate. Really, however, the black belt is only a beginning of another journey, into the great breadth and depth of the martial arts.
Summary
Teaching tangible self-defense skills in a friendly, collegiate atmosphere, Shorin-Ryu Karate Club draws on the strength of its members to enhance the martial arts experience. Although we pride ourselves on training in the traditional Okinawan skills, we also incorporate modern methods into our training to assure the best class content possible. We attend a few local tournaments, and individuals are encouraged to explore seminars that come to the Chicago area. Since we associate with a second Shorin-Ryu dojo (located at the YMCA), we enjoy a great sharing of knowledge, skill and camaraderie. We are always happy to welcome new members.","shorinryukarateclub82@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/shorin-ryu-karate-club/contact","No Instagram available","https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/8fb61c44-54e8-4946-abf6-bb6d7b5352ad218c2954-2d86-4157-9e6d-06941100558d.jpg?preset=small-sq"

"Sigma Chi - Lambda","In 1855, seven young men, Benjamin Piatt Runkle, Thomas Cowan Bell, William Lewis Lockwood, Isaac M. Jordan, Daniel William Cooper, Franklin Howard Scobey and James Parks Caldwell, wanted something better in a fraternity during their collegiate experience, and from that recognition, a dream was born — the fraternity of Sigma Chi.
In short, Sigma Chi began because good men chose to act.
Our seven Founders recognized that a principle-driven lifestyle should be paramount in an individual’s lifelong quest to achieve progressive development, and that the world in which they lived had a great need for ethical leaders whose core principles were based on the possession of remarkable character.
Sigma Chi’s story has been building on itself since 1855 and, indeed, the Fraternity has changed dramatically since that time. When those seven college students gathered together for the first time, there were no telephones, no automobiles, no planes, no Internet, not even electricity — essentially, their lives were devoid of any of the modern amenities we are used to. Yet, somehow, they prospered.
Without iPhones, the Internet, rapid transit, or even the possibility of an immediate connection outside of the small town of Oxford, Ohio, and their roughly 300 fellow students, they somehow knew that they had planted the seed for something amazing to grow. Through it all, they found in themselves and each other an uncommon strength of character to pursue a dream and to pass that dream on to other young men who would carry it forward.
Their dream was simple — to enhance the leadership abilities of men by refining their character through the framework of Friendship, Justice and Learning — our three guiding principles.
Seven young men set the foundation for a lifelong course of development that has since provided more than 300,000 men with the structure to understand how to make a positive influence on the world.
The ranks of Sigma Chis now include titans of industry, celebrities, political leaders, husbands, fathers, brothers and many more. Each member brings so many different characteristics to the world, yet we all bring the same endowment of character that our world today so badly needs.
Principle-driven leaders are needed now more than ever before, and the fact that Sigma Chi makes a concerted effort to contribute to the development of such men is what makes the Fraternity so important today.","SigmaChiWisconsin@gmail.com","https://uwmadison.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/sigma-chi_lambda-chapter/contact","https://www.instagram.com/sigmachiwisconsin/https://www.instagram.com/sigmachiwisconsin/","No image available"
