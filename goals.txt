BadgerApp based on BruinDining(Nom) on AppStore

1. One Page, list of all dining halls, show hours and open or not, click to see each menu, 
add portions eaten to determine macros, include map and location of dining hall at the bottom, 
webscrape all items and ingredients, mongodb instead of csv?, maybe show whether its crowded or not by user
input?, notifications if a specific food item appears in the dining hall

2. Another page, events page/clubs can post their events and meetings, filter for only "followed" clubs or all clubs, 
subtab for club discovery page where u can find more info about the club based on preferences listed, vectorize
